Abies amabilis,Pinaceae,Red Fir,Tree,E,30.0,5.0,5.0,"This plant was used quite widely by native North American Indians. An infusion of the bark was used as a tonic and to treat stomach ailments, TB, haemorrhoids and various minor complaints[257]. The pitch, or resin, was also used to treat colds, sore throats etc[257].



The bark of this tree contains blisters that are filled with a resin called 'Canadian Balsam'[226]. Although the report does not mention the uses of this resin, it can almost certainly be used in the same ways as the resin of A. balsamea, as detailed below:-



The resin obtained from this tree (see 'Uses notes' below) has been used throughout the world and is a very effective antiseptic and healing agent. It is used as a healing and analgesic protective covering for burns, bruises, wounds and sores[213, 222, 226]. It is also used to treat sore nipples[213] and is said to be one of the best curatives for a sore throat[245].

The resin is also antiscorbutic, diuretic, stimulant and tonic[4, 171, 222]. It is used internally in propriety mixtures to treat coughs and diarrhoea, though taken in excess it is purgative[238].

A warm liquid of the gummy sap was drunk as a treatment for gonorrhoea[212].

A tea made from the leaves is antiscorbutic[4, 171]. It is used in the treatment of coughs, colds and fevers[222]. The leaves and young shoots are best harvested in the spring and dried for later use[238].",North-western N. America - Alaska to Oregon.,"High mountain slopes and benches, going down to sea-level in the north of its range[82]. The best specimens grow in deep moist soils and cool wet air conditions such as fog belts[229].",LMH,FSN,M,False,False,AN,False,False,False,N,S,N,False,False,False,Wind,,None known,,"Requires a good moist but not water-logged soil in a sheltered position[1]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Plants are very shade tolerant[11, 81] but growth is slower in dense shade[81]. Intolerant of atmospheric pollution[1]. Prefers slightly acid conditions down to a pH of about 5[200]. Prefers growing on a north-facing slope[200]. Trees are somewhat shallow rooted and are therefore susceptible to strong winds[229].

Grows best in the Perthshire valleys of Scotland[11]. It does very well on glacial moraines in Scotland[81]. When grown in an open position, the tree clothes itself to the ground with gracefully drooping branches, though on the whole, this species does not grow well in Britain[11]. Trees have been of variable growth in this country and seem to be short-lived[185]. The best and fastest growing specimens are to be found in the north and far west of the country[185]. Growth in girth can be very quick, 1.8 metres in 35 years has been recorded[185].

Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm in height. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200].

The crushed leaves have an odour like orange peel[11].

Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200].

This species is often confused with A. nordmanniana[11].

A very ornamental plant[1]. Trees are sometimes grown as 'Christmas trees'[200].

Plants are susceptible to injury by aphis[11].","Young shoot tips are used as a substitute for tea[177, 183].

The pitch obtained from the bark can be hardened (probably by immersing it in cold water[K]) and used as a chewing gum[257].

Inner bark[257]. No further information is given, but inner bark can be dried, ground into a powder and then used with grain flours etc to make bread and other preparations[257].","The boughs are fragrant and can be hung in the home as an air freshener[257].

Wood - hard, light, not strong, close grained, not very durable. It is used for framing small buildings but is not strong enough for larger buildings. It is also used for crates, pulp etc[46, 61, 82, 226, 229].



This tree yields the resin 'Canadian Balsam'[226]. The report does not mention the uses of this balsam, but the following are the ways that it is used when obtained from A. balsamea:-



The balsamic resin 'Balm of Gilead'[11, 46] or 'Canada Balsam' according to other reports[64, 226, 238] is obtained during July and August from blisters in the bark or by cutting pockets in the wood[222]. Another report says that it is a turpentine[171]. It is used medicinally and in dentistry, also in the manufacture of glues, candles and as a cement for microscopes and slides - it has a high refractive index resembling that of glass[11, 46, 64, 82, 222, 226, 238]. The average yield is about 8 - 10 oz per tree[171]. The resin is also a fixative in soaps and perfumery[171, 238].","Seed - sow early February in a greenhouse or outdoors in March[78]. Germination is often poor, usually taking about 6 - 8 weeks[78]. Stratification is said to produce a more even germination so it is probably best to sow the seed in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the autumn[80, 113]. The seed remains viable for up to 5 years if it is well stored[113]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on for at least their first winter in pots. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.

Alternatively, if you have sufficient seed, it is possible to sow in an outdoor seedbed. One report says that it is best to grow the seedlings on in the shade at a density of about 550 plants per square metre[78] whilst another report says that they are best grown on in a sunny position[80].",True,1,,False,2,Douglas. ex Forbes.,True,North-western N.

It is used as a healing and analgesic protective covering for burns, bruises, wounds and sores[213, 222, 226]. It is also used to treat sore nipples[213] and is said to be one of the best curatives for a sore throat[245]. The buds, resin, and/or sap are used in folk remedies for treating cancers, corns, and warts[269].

The resin is also antiscorbutic, diaphoretic, diuretic, stimulant and tonic[4, 171, 222]. It is used internally in propriety mixtures to treat coughs and diarrhoea, though taken in excess it is purgative[238].

A warm liquid of the gummy sap was drunk as a treatment for gonorrhoea[212].

A tea made from the leaves is antiscorbutic[4, 171]. It is used in the treatment of coughs, colds and fevers[222]. The leaves and young shoots are best harvested in the spring and dried for later use[238].

This plant was widely used medicinally by various North American Indian tribes[257]. The resin was used as an antiseptic healing agent applied externally to wounds, sores, bites etc., it was used as an inhalant to treat headaches and was also taken internally to treat colds, sore throats and various other complaints[257].","North-eastern N.

The foliage has also induced contact dermatitis[269].",Pinus balsamea.,"Prefers a good moist but not water-logged soil[1]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Very shade tolerant, especially when young[81, 126], but growth is slower in dense shade[81]. Intolerant of atmospheric pollution[1]. Prefers slightly acid conditions down to a pH of about5[200], though the cultivar 'Hudsonia' is more tolerant of alkaline conditions[238]. Prefers growing on a north-facing slope[200]. A shallow-rooted plant, making it vulnerable to high winds[229]. Balsam fir is estimated to tolerate an annual precipitation of 60 to 150cm, an annual temperature range of 5 to 12Â°C, and a pH of 4.5 to 7.5[269].

The balsam fir is a fast-growing tree in its native environment[229], but it is fairly short-lived and slow growing in Britain, becoming ungainly after about 20 years[11, 64, 81]. It grows best in the Perthshire valleys of Scotland[11, 185]. New growth takes place from late May to the end of July[185]. Trees are very cold hardy but are often excited into premature growth in mild winters and this new growth is susceptible to damage by late frosts[11]. Female strobili may be wholly or partially aborted up to 6 to 8 weeks after bud burst by late spring frosts[269]. Pollen dispersal can be reduced by adverse weather[269].

Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm in height. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200].

Trees have a thin bark and are therefore susceptible to forest fires[229].

This species is closely related to A. fraseri[11].

Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. The cones break up on the tree and if seed is required it should be harvested before the cones break up in early autumn[80].

Whilst the typical species is too large for most gardens, there are some named slow-growing dwarf forms that can be grown[238]. Whilst these will not provide the resin, their leaves can be used medicinally[K].

The leaves are strongly aromatic of balsam when crushed[185]. The tree is sometimes grown and used as a 'Christmas tree'[226].","Inner bark - cooked. It is usually dried, ground into a powder and then used as a thickening in soups etc or mixed with cereals when making bread[105, 177]. Fir bark is a delight to chew in winter or early spring, slightly mucilaginous and sweetish, better raw than cooked[269]. Another report says that it is an emergency food and is only used when all else fails[183].

An aromatic resinous pitch is found in blisters in the bark[64]. When eaten raw it is delicious and chewy[101, 183]. Another report says that the balsam or pitch, in extreme emergency, forms a highly concentrated, though disagreeable, food[269].  An oleoresin from the pitch is used as a flavouring in sweets, baked goods, ice cream and drinks[183].

Tips of young shoots are used as a tea substitute[177, 183].","The balsamic resin 'Balm of Gilead'[11, 46] or 'Canada Balsam' according to other reports[64, 226, 238] is obtained during July and August from blisters in the bark or by cutting pockets in the wood[222]. Another report says that it is a turpentine[171]. The term Canada Balsam is a misnomer because balsams are supposed to contain benzoic and cinnamic acids, both absent from the Canada oleoresin[269]. Turpentine is also a misnomer, implying that the oleoresin is entirely steam volatile. Actually it contains 70 - 80% resin, only 16 - 20% volatile oil[269]. Canada Balsam yields 15 - 25% volatile oil, the resin being used for caulking and incense[269].  It is used medicinally and in dentistry, also in the manufacture of glues, candles and as a cement for microscopes and slides - it has a high refractive index resembling that of glass[11, 46, 64, 82, 222, 226, 238]. The pitch has also been used as a waterproofing material for the seams of canoes[257]. The average yield is about 8 - 10 oz per tree[171]. The resin is also a fixative in soaps and perfumery[171, 238]. ""Turpentine"" is usually collected during July-August by breaking the turpentine blisters into small metal cans with sharp-pointed lids. Trees are then allowed to recuperate for 1 - 2 years before being harvested again[269].

The leaves and young branches are used as a stuffing material for pillows etc - they impart a pleasant scent[46, 61, 257] and also repel moths[169].

The leaves contain an average of 0.65% essential oil, though it can go up to 1.4% or even higher[269]. One analysis of the essential oils reports 14.6% bornyl acetate, 36.1% b-pinene, 11.1% 3-carene, 11.1% limonene, 6.8% camphene, and 8.4% a-pinene[269]. To harvest the oil, it would appear that the branches should be snipped off younger trees in early spring[269]. Fifteen year old trees yield 70% more leaf oil than 110-year-old trees; oil yields are highest in January - March and September, they are lowest from April to August[269].

A thread can be made from the roots[257].

Wood - light, soft, coarse grained, not strong, not very durable. Weighs 24lb per cubic foot[235]. Used mainly for pulp, it is not used much for lumber except in the manufacture of crates etc[46, 82, 226, 229]. The wood is commercially valuable for timber even though it is relatively soft, weak, and perishable[269]. Balsam fir is used in the US for timber and plywood, and is the mainstay of the pulp wood industry in the Northeast. The wood, which is rich in pitch, burns well and can be used as a kindling[257]","Seed - sow early February in a greenhouse or outdoors in March[78]. Germination is often poor, usually taking about 6 - 8 weeks[78]. Stratification is said to produce a more even germination so it is probably best to sow the seed in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the autumn[80, 113]. Stored seeds should be moist stratified 14 - 28 days at 1 - 5Â°C, though fresh seed may be sown in autumn without stratification, with target seedling densities in the nursery ca 450 - 500/m2, often mulched with sawdust. The seed remains viable for up to 5 years if it is well stored[113]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on for at least their first winter in pots. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Of slow initial growth, the stock is usually outplanted as 2- to 3-year-old seedlings or 3- to 4-year-old transplants

Alternatively, if you have sufficient seed, it is possible to sow in an outdoor seedbed. One report says that it is best to grow the seedlings on in the shade at a density of about 550 plants per square metre[78] whilst another report says that they are best grown on in a sunny position[80].

Trees often self-layer in the wild[226], so this might be a means of increasing named varieties in cultivation[K].",True,3,Y,True,5,(L.)Mill.,True,North-eastern N. America,"Newfoundland to Virginia, west to Alberta, Michigan and Ohio.",N. America

Prefers slightly acid conditions down to a pH of about 5, though it also succeeds in very chalky soils[200]. Prefers growing on a north-facing slope[200].

This species needs careful siting because it usually comes into leaf early in the spring and the young growth can be damaged by late frosts[11, 185]. Trees can therefore be rather slow to establish[185]. A position sheltered from early morning sun is preferred and frost hollows should be avoided[11, K].

Trees grow very well in Britain, and unlike most other members of this genus they succeed in southern and south-eastern England[11] though they are slow growing there. They are at their best in the Perthshire valleys of Scotland and the far west of Britain where growth is much faster[11, 185]. Growth in girth can be quite fast, 2 metres in 40 years has been recorded[185]. The species has been cultivated for timber in Italy[50].

Prefers slightly acid conditions down to a pH of about 5[200]. Prefers growing on a north-facing slope[200]. Trees succeed on poor dry sites in the wild[155]. Trees are shallow rooted and therefore liable to be wind-blown in exposed sites[155].

Trees grow almost as well in S. Britain as they do in cooler areas of the country[11]. They are at their best in the Perthshire valleys of Scotland and in N.E. England, trees in the south and east of the country tend to be thin in the crown and soon lose their shape. Trees in the west grow better but also lose their shape after a while[11, 185]. New growth is from mid-May to July and trees are virtually never damaged by late frosts or aphis[1, 185].

Most trees of this species that are grown in Britain are in fact the sub-species A. concolor lowiana. (Gordon.)Lemmon. This form tends to grow better in Britain than the type. There are 2 basic forms of this sub-species, those from the north of the range are vigorous in height growth whilst the southern form is vigorous in girth growth[185]. They both have a potential for forestry use in Britain[185].

New growth of the side shoots starts in April and this is very susceptible to damage by late frosts[11, 185]. The terminal buds do not open until mid-May and usually escape damage[185]. Trees are fairly fast growing when young, sending up new growth of 60cm a year from the age of about 6 years[185].

The average yield is about 8 - 10 oz per tree[171]. The resin is also a fixative in soaps and perfumery[171].

Leaves are a stuffing material for pillows etc - they impart a pleasant scent[46, 61] and also repel moths[169]","Seed - sow early February in a greenhouse or outdoors in March[78]. Germination is often poor, usually taking about 6 - 8 weeks[78]. Stratification is said to produce a more even germination so it is probably best to sow the seed in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the autumn[80, 113]. The seed remains viable for up to 5 years if it is well stored[113].

This species thrives exceedingly well in the moister parts of Britain, where it grows very quickly[11]. It is cultivated for timber in W. and N. Europe[50]. Trees are slow growing for the first few years but they are then quite fast with trees growing 60 - 100cm in height and 8cm in girth per year even when they are quite large[1, 185]. New growth takes place from early May to July[185].  Trees grow best in the Perthshire valleys of Scotland and in the far west of Britain[11]. Some trees have reached heights in excess of 60 metres in 100 years in Wales and Scotland, making them amongst the tallest trees in Europe[200].

A very ornamental plant[1], it is rarely harmed by disease, insects or frost[1]. 

The crushed leaves have a fruity orange-flavoured aroma[185].

A fast-growing tree for the first 20 - 30years of its life, it may live for 75 - 100 years[229].

Red maple is a bad companion plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants[18, 20].

A variable species with several sub-species[227], there are also many named varieties that have been selected for their ornamental value[200].

This species is often confused with A. saccharinum[11].","The sap contains sugar and this can be used as a drink or be concentrated into a syrup by boiling off the water[2, 11, 74, 159].

It makes a good maple syrup although the yield is comparatively small[183]. It can be harvested in late winter, the flow is best on warm sunny days following a frost. The best sap production comes from cold-winter areas with continental climates.

Inner bark - cooked[105, 177]. It is dried, ground into a powder and then used as a thickening in soups etc or mixed with cereals when making bread[161].

Self-sown seedlings, gathered in early spring, are eaten fresh or dried for later use[213].

The boiled inner bark yields a purple colour[4, 57, 82]. Mixed with lead sulphate this produces a black dye which can also be used as an ink[4]. The dye is dark blue according to another report[95].

The wood is used to make basket splints[257].

This species can successfully establish itself in recently cleared areas and partially open woodlands[229]. It can therefore be used as a pioneer species to speed the regeneration of woodland[K].

Wood - not strong, close grained, hard, very heavy[46, 82, 227]. It weighs 38lb per cubic foot[227]. The grain of some old specimens is undulated, this gives beautiful effects of light and shade on polished surfaces[4].

A very ornamental tree[1] but a bad companion plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants[18, 20].

This species is commercially exploited in America for its sap[1, 11]. Along with its sub-species it is the major source of maple syrup[11]. There are some named varieties[183]. The sap can be tapped within 10 - 15 years from seed but it does not flow so well in areas with mild winters[160].","The sap contains quite a large proportion of sugar. This can be used as a refreshing drink, or be concentrated into a syrup by boiling off the water[1, 2, 11, 34, 57]. The syrup is used as a sweetener on many foods. The sap can be harvested in late winter or early spring[[142], the flow is best on a warm sunny day after a frost[213]. Trees on southern slopes in sandy soils give the best yields. It is best to make a hole about 7cm deep and about 1.3 metres above the ground[171]. Yields of 40 - 100 litres per tree can be obtained[142]. The best sap production comes from cold-winter areas with continental climates. The sap contains 2 - 6% sugar, thus about 32 litres are required to make a litre of maple syrup[229].

Succeeds in semi-shade but full sun is best for fruit production[3, 126, 200]. Prefers a sheltered position[200]. Does well when grown into trees[K].

Plants requires a 6 - 8 month frost-free growing season[160, 200]. They are hardy to about -12Â°c when fully dormant but young growth is very subject to damage by late frosts, being killed back at -2Â°c[160, 200]. Plants also require a winter chilling of 600 - 1100 hours below 7Â°c and a long warm summer to ripen the fruit[200].

Plants fruit on second year wood or on fruit spurs produced on older wood[126], any pruning is best carried out in the winter[219]. The flowers are sweetly scented[245].

A very ornamental plant[1], it is widely cultivated in warm temperate zones for its edible fruit, there are many named varieties[183, 200]. The fruit can store for up to 9 months at 0Â°c with a relative humidity of 90%, but under domestic conditions 4 - 6 weeks is optimal[200].

This is a rampant climbing plant, supporting itself by twining around branches etc[200].

Plants have been seen with very good crops of fruit at the Hillier Arboretum in Hampshire in several autumns. These plants had outgrown their planned supports and had climbed 15 metres into neighbouring trees. The main problem with them would be how to harvest the fruit[K].

The female 'Heywood' is the most commonly cultivated form in Britain (1993), its fruits store well but it tends to flower late and there can be problems with pollination[126]. The cultivar 'Blake' is said to be fast cropping and self-fertile[200]. The male 'Tomurii' is free-flowering and disease-resistant[202].

Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].

Plants are usually dioecious, but hermaphrodite forms are known. However, the fruit quality and yield of these hermaphrodite forms is usually inferior[11]. Male and female plants must usually be grown if seed is required, one male to five or six females is normally adequate.","Fruit - raw or cooked. A delicious flavour[1, 2, 3, 11, 105], the fruit can be up to 8cm long, it is very juicy when fully ripe and has a refreshing, acid flavour[K]. It contains a number of small seeds, but these are easily eaten with the fruit[K]. Rich in vitamin C[183]. Fresh fruits contain 100 - 420mg vitamin C per 100g and 8 - 14% carbohydrate[218]. Acidity is 1 - 2%, mainly citric acid[218]. The fruit ripens in November and can store for 3 - 4 months[132]. Yields of 8 - 30 tonnes per hectare are possible[218].

Leaves are a famine food[179].","Paper is made from the bark[178].

Most of the minerals etc would also have been leached out by this treatment[K].","Saponins in the seed are a soap substitute[169]. The saponins can be easily obtained by chopping the seed into small pieces and infusing them in hot water.

There is some confusion over the name of this species, it is included by some authorities as a synonym of A. fordii (q.v.), though this synonymy might refer to A. cordata. Muell-Arg[109].  A. cordata.(A.Juss.)Steud. is a synonym of A. montana. (Lour.)Wilson. a tree that is native to S.W. China[171].

This species (A cordata [Thunb.)Steud.) is cultivated for its oil in western Japan[275]. It is distinguished from A. montana by the glands at apex of petiole and the leaves with white or brown hairs at branching parts of veins of lower surface[275]. Aleurites montana (Lour.) Wilson, which is distributed in S. China to Indochina and cultivated in China and rarely in western Japan, differs from A. fordii in having ovoid verrucose fruits, that of A. fordii being smooth and spherical[275].

The leaves and seeds contain a toxic saponin[218]. Although poisonous, saponins are poorly absorbed by the human body and so most pass through without harm. Saponins are quite bitter and can be found in many common foods such as some beans. They can be removed by carefully leaching in running water. Thorough cooking, and perhaps changing the cooking water once, will also normally remove most of them. However, it is not advisable to eat large quantities of food that contain saponins. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K].",,"One report says that the plant is very tolerant of soil conditions[74]. It is easily grown in a loamy soil but the plants are unable to withstand much frost[1]. Requires a lime-free soil[200]. The Tung tree is reported to tolerate an annual precipitation of 64 - 173cm, average temperatures ranging from 18.7 - 26.2Â°C, and a pH of 5.4 - 7.1[269].

Tung trees are very exacting in climatic and soil requirements[269]. They require long, hot summers with abundant moisture, with usually at least 112 cm of rainfall rather evenly distributed through the year[269]. Trees require 350 - 400 hours in winter with temperatures 7.2Â°C or lower - without this cold requirement, trees tend to produce suckers from the main branches. Vigorous but not succulent growth is the most cold resistant - trees are susceptible to cold injury when in active growth[269].

Production of tung is best where day and night temperatures are uniformly warm. Much variation reduces tree growth and fruit size. Trees grow best if planted on hilltops or slopes, as good air-drainage reduces losses from spring frosts. Contour-planting on high rolling land escapes frost damage. Tung makes its best growth on virgin land. Soils must be well-drained, deep aerated, and have a high moisture-holding capacity to be easily penetrated by the roots. Green manure crops and fertilizers may be needed. Dolomitic lime may be used to correct excessive acidity; pH 6.0 - 6.5 is best; liming is beneficial to most soils in the Tung Belt, the more acid soils requiring greater amounts of lime[269].

Trees are not very cold hardy outdoors in Britain[200]. Another report says that they are fairly hardy[74].

A very ornamental tree[74], it is cultivated in China for the oil contained in its seed[74, 109, 269]. There are some named varieties[269].

Seedlings generally vary considerably from parent plants in growth and fruiting characters. Seedlings which have been self-pollinated for several generations give rather uniform plants[269]. Only 1 out of 100 selected 'mother' tung trees will produce seedlings sufficiently uniform for commercial planting[269]. Usually seedling trees outgrow budded trees, but budded trees produce larger crops and are more uniform in production, oil content and date of fruit maturity[269].",Seed[105]. There are no more details but the report should be treated with caution since the oil from the seed is said to be poisonous[65].,"The seed contains up to 58% of a superior quick-drying oil that is used in the manufacture of lacquers, varnishes, paints, linoleum, oilcloth, resins, artificial leather, felt-base floor coverings, greases, brake-linings and in clearing and polishing compounds. Tung oil products are used to coat containers for food, beverages, and medicines; for insulating wires and other metallic surfaces, as in radios, radar, telephone and telegraph instruments[1, 46, 57, 61, 74, 269]. During World War II, the Chinese used tung oil for motor fuel. It tended to gum up the engines, so they processed it to make it compatible with gasoline. The mixture worked fine[269]. The oil is very resistant to weathering[171]. The oil is said to have insecticidal properties[218]. The fruit contains between 14 - 20% oil, the kernel 53 - 60% and the nut 30 - 40%[218, 269]. The oil contains 75 - 80% a-elaeo stearic, 15% oleic-, ca 4% palmitic-, and ca 1% stearic-acids[269]. Tannins, phytosterols, and a poisonous saponin are also reported[269]. Trees yield 4.5 - 5 tonnes of fruit per hectare[269].

Tung trees usually begin bearing fruit the third year after planting, and are usually in commercial production by the fourth or fifth year, attaining maximum production in 10 - 12 years. Average life of trees in United States is 30 years. Fruits mature and drop to ground in late September to early November. At this time they contain about 60% moisture. Fruits must be dried to 15% moisture before processing. Fruits should be left on ground 3 - 4 weeks until hulls are dead and dry, and the moisture content has dropped below 30%. Fruits are gathered by hand into baskets or sacks. Fruits do not deteriorate on ground until they germinate in spring[269].","Seed - sow March/April in a warm greenhouse. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on for at least the first winter in a greenhouse. Plant out in early summer and give the plants some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors. Tung seed are normally short-lived and must be planted during the season following harvest. Seeds are best hulled before planting, as hulls retard germination. Hulled seed may be planted dry, but soaking in water for 5 - 7 days hastens germination. Stratification, cold treatment or chemical treatment of seeds brings about more rapid and uniform germination. Dry-stored seed should be planted no later than February; stratified seed by mid-March; cold-treated and chemical treated seed by early April[269].

Cuttings of mature wood in a frame[200].

Most successful budding is done in late August, by the simple shield method, requiring piece of budstock bark, including a bud, that will fit into a cut in the rootstock bar[269]. A T-shaped cut is made in bark of rootstock at point 5 - 7.5 cm above ground level, the flaps of bark loosened, shield-bud slipped inside flaps and the flaps tied tightly over the transplanted bud with rubber budding stripe, 12 cm long, 0.6 cm wide, 0.002 thick. After about 7 days, rubber stripe is cut to prevent binding. As newly set buds are susceptible to cold injury, soil is mounded over them for winter. When growth starts in spring, soil is pulled back and each stock cut back to within 3.5 cm of the dormant bud. Later, care consists of keeping all suckers removed and the trees well-cultivated[269]. Spring budding is done only as a last resort if necessary trees are not propagated the previous fall[269].",False,2,Y,False,3,Hemsl.,True,E. Asia,Central and Western China.,Asia

Its fast rate of growth means that it quickly provides sheltered conditions to allow more permanent woodland trees to become established. In addition, bacteria on the roots fix atmospheric nitrogen - whilst this enables the tree to grow well in quite poor soils it also makes some of this nitrogen available to other plants growing nearby. Alder trees also have a heavy leaf canopy and when the leaves fall in the autumn they help to build up the humus content of the soil. Alder seedlings do not compete well in shady woodland conditions and so this species gradually dies out as the other trees become established[K].

The tree has an extensive root system and can be planted to control banks from erosion[226].

The bark and the strobils are a source of tannin[82]. A dark dye is obtained from the bark[226]. The colour can range from orange through red to brown[257].

This plant is used in North America in much the same way as A. montana is used in Europe[254]. These uses are as follows:-



Arnica has a long history of herbal use, especially as an external treatment for bruises and sprains[232, 238] - it is an ingredient of a number of proprietary preparations[238. Internally, it has been used in the treatment of heart complaints and as a booster for the immune system[238]. Arnica increases local blood supply and accelerates healing, it is anti-inflammatory and increases the rate of absorption of internal bleeding[254]. Generally the plant is nowadays only recommended for internal use as a homeopathic medicine, principally for treating shock, injury and pain[254]. If used as a decoction or tincture it stimulates the circulation and is valuable in the treatment of angina and a weak or failing heart, but it can be toxic even at quite low doses and so is rarely used this way[254].

The flowers are the part most commonly used[4, 232], they are harvested when fully open and dried - the receptacles are sometimes removed since these are liable to be attacked by insects[4]. The root is also used, it is harvested after the leaves have died down in the autumn and dried for later use[4].

The whole plant is antiecchymotic, antiphlogistic, nervine, sternutatory, vulnerary[4, 7, 9, 46, 165]. Although a very valuable remedy, it should be used with caution. It has been known to cause contact dermatitis when used externally and collapse when taken internally[238]. Only take it internally under the supervision of a qualified practitioner.

The freshly crushed flowers cause sneezing if inhaled[232].

The leaves have also been smoked as a tobacco[232], though it is unclear whether this was for medicinal reasons

Requires abundant moisture and plenty of organic matter in the soil. Plants are intolerant of drought[1]. Succeeds in full sun or dappled shade in warm, humid, damp conditions[200].

Some reports say that this plant is only hardy in S.W. England[1, 11, 25] though another report says that the roots are hardy to about -30Â°c if they are heavily mulched[169].

This plant used to form very extensive stands in much of south-eastern N. America, but it provides a nutritious forage and is very easily destroyed by the continuous grazing of cattle or the rooting of pigs and so has been greatly reduced in the wild[236].

This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200].

Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122].

The rootstock is running, forming new shoots from late May[25].","Young shoots - cooked[11, 22, 46, 105, 183]. Used as a pot-herb[236].

Seed - cooked[46, 61, 161]. It can be used as a wheat substitute[2, 105], for which it is not much inferior[213], but it is rather small and difficult to collect in quantity[159].

The hollow stems can be made into flutes[257].","Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20Â°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Bamboos only flower at intervals of several years and so seed is rarely available.

Division in late spring as new growth commences. Take divisions with at least three canes in the clump, trying to cause as little root disturbance to the main plant as possible. Grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse in pots of a high fertility sandy medium. Mist the foliage regularly until plants are established. Plant them out into their permanent positions when a good root system has developed, which can take a year or more[200].

The papaw produces a delicious edible fruit which is a potentially commercial crop[61]. The wild-collected fruit is often sold in local markets in America[82]. The tree commences bearing in 4 - 6 years from seed and yields up to 30 kilos per tree[160]. There are some named varieties[183]. The mature fruit is rarely seen in Britain[182], only ripening after a long hot summer[200]. A small tree growing against a south-facing wall at Bristol Botanical Gardens had a small crop of immature fruit in early September 1996 (following the hot summer of 1995) - this was the first time it had been seen to bear fruit[K].

Flowers are formed in the leaf axils of wood produced the previous summer[82, 229].

Established plants resent root disturbance, the best plants are obtained by planting them out into their permanent positions as young as possible though young plants should be given some protection for their first year or two[200].

Another report says that the white fruits are mildly flavoured and later ripening than the orange fruits[227]. The fruit can also be used for making preserves, pies, ice cream and other sweet desserts[183]. The fruit falls from the tree in autumn and is then stored until fully ripe[227]. The fruit can cause gastro-intestinal upsets for some people[274].","A fibre from the inner bark is used for making strong rope and string[61, 82, 227, 257].

The seed usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 15Â°c[134]. Stored seed requires stratification, it has embryo dormancy and an impermeable seedcoat and can take up to 18 months to germinate[113, 134]. Dried seed quickly loses its viability. As soon as the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for t least their first winter.

In particular oats are a nutritious food that gently restores vigour after debilitating illnesses, helps lower cholesterol levels in the blood and also increases stamina[254].

The seed is a mealy nutritive herb that is antispasmodic, cardiac, diuretic, emollient, nervine and stimulant[4, 7, 21, 165]. The seed contains the antitumor compound b-sitosterol and has been used as a folk remedy for tumours[269]. A gruel made from the ground seed is used as a mild nutritious aliment in inflammatory cases, fevers and after parturition[4]. It should be avoided in cases of dyspepsia accompanied with acidity of the stomach[4]. A tincture of the ground seed in alcohol is useful as a nervine and uterine tonic[4]. A decoction strained into a bath will help to soothe itchiness and eczema[254].

A poultice made from the ground seeds is used in the treatment of eczema and dry skin[238].

When consumed regularly, oat germ reduces blood cholesterol levels[238].

Oat straw and the grain are prescribed to treat general debility and a wide range of nervous conditions[254. They are mildly antidepressant, gently raising energy levels and supporting an over-stressed nervous system[254]. They are of particular value in helping a person to cope with the exhaustion that results from multiple sclerosis, chronic neurological pain and insomnia[254]. Oats are thought to stimulate sufficient nervous energy to help relieve insomnia[254].

An alcoholic extraction of oats has been reported to be a deterrent for smoking, though reports that oat extract helped correct the tobacco habit have been disproven[269].

A tincture of the plant has been used as a nerve stimulant and to treat opium addiction.

In an article riddled with errors, the Globe (February 28, 1984) reports that oat straw, usually taken as a tea, is a sexual nerve tonic[269].",N. Europe.

They prefer a poor dry soil[134] and tolerate cool moist conditions[13]. Plants are reported to tolerate an annual precipitation of 20 to 180cm, an average annual temperature range of 5 to 26Â°C, and a pH of 4.5 to 8.6[269]. They thrive on a wide range of soils of ample, but not excessive, fertility[269]. Well-drained neutral soils in regions where annual rainfall is 77cm or more are best[269]. Loam soils are best, especially silt and clay loams[269]. The plants are also reported to tolerate aluminium, disease, frost, fungus, herbicides, hydrogen fluoride, mycobacterium, nematode, rust, SO2, smut, and virus[269].

Oats have a long history of cultivation as a food crop and are believed to be derived chiefly from two species, wild oat (A. fatua L.) and wild red oat (A. sterilis L.)[269]. They are widely cultivated for their seed, used as a source of protein, as well as for hay, as winter cover, and are used as a pasture crop in the growing or 'milk' stage[269].

Oats are long-day plants, grown in cool climates in the Old and New World temperate zones, succeeding under variable conditions[269]. Oats usually are not very winter hardy, although winter hardy cvs have been developed[269]. A very hardy plant according to another report, the cultivated oat succeeds as far north as latitude 70Â°n[142] and is widely cultivated in temperate zones for its edible seed, there are many named varieties[183].

Although lower yielding than wheat (Triticum spp.), it is able to withstand a wider range of climatic conditions and is therefore more cultivated in cooler and wetter areas[13]. Hot dry weather just before heading causes heads to blast and yields of seed to decrease[269].

Self-pollination is normal, but cross-pollination by wind also occurs[269]. If you wish to save the seed for sowing, each variety should be isolated about 180 metres away from other varieties[269].

Oats grow well with vetch but they inhibit the growth of apricot trees[18, 201].

Oats are in general easily grown plants but, especially when grown on a small scale, the seed is often completely eaten out by birds. Some sort of netting seems to be the best answer on a garden scale.","Seed - cooked[2, 34, 46, 177]. The seed ripens in the latter half of summer and, when harvested and dried, can store for several years. It has a floury texture and a mild, somewhat creamy flavour. It can be used as a staple food crop in either savoury or sweet dishes. Used as a cereal, it is probably best known as the breakfast cereal porridge but it can also be used in many other ways. The seed can be sprouted and used in salads[183], the grain can also be ground into a flour and used in making biscuits, sourdough etc[183]. It is fairly low in gluten, and so is not really suitable for making bread[269]. The seed is an especially good food for convalescents and people with stomach problems[13]. Oat flour produced in the dry-milling operation currently is used as an antioxidant in food products[269]. Oat flour inhibits rancidity and increases the length of shelf-stability of fatty foods such as vegetable oils[269]. Whilst cultivated oats average about 17% protein, scientists screening thousands of samples of cultivated and wild species found that the wild species averaged 27% with some forms ranging up to 37%[269].

Oats are also one of the cereals used as a basic ingredient for making whisky[7].

Oats are harvested when grain is in the hard dough stage and straw is slightly green (when the moisture content of the grain is 14% or less). If too ripe, shattering causes seed loss. Crop is usually cut with binder and left in the field until dry and then threshed. In mechanized societies, oats are combined directly from standing grain. For this type of harvesting, crop must be fully ripe, usually when the straw has lost greenness and glumes have become white. Crop may be combined from windrow, or cut with a header harvester when the crop is dead ripe. Seeds are threshed and cleaned by winnowing, and artificially dried to below 14% moisture for storage[269].

The roasted seed is a coffee substitute[177, 183].

An edible oil is obtained from the seed, it is used in the manufacture of breakfast cereals[61].","The straw has a wide range of uses such as for bio-mass, fibre, mulch, paper-making, building board and thatching[74, 141, 171]. It has also been used as a stuffing material for mattresses and these are said to be of great benefit for sufferers from rheumatism[7, 254]. Some caution is advised in its use as a mulch since oat straw can infest strawberries with stem and bulb eelworm.

Oat hulls are basic in production of furfural, a chemical intermediate in the production of many industrial products such as nylon, lubricating oils, butadiene, phenolic resin glues, and rubber tread compositions[269]. Oats hulls supply about 22% of the required furfural raw materials. Rice hulls, corn cobs, bagasse, and beech woods make up much of the remainder[269].

Oats hulls are also used in the manufacture of construction boards, cellulose pulp and as a filter in breweries[269].

A handful of the grains, thrown into the bath water, will help to keep the skin soft because of their emollient action[7].

If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122].

New shoots appear in late spring, the rootstock is caespitose[25]. 

A polymorphic species, there are many named varieties selected for their ornamental value[25, 195].","Young shoots - cooked[46, 105]. Bitter tasting, they are rarely eaten[195]. They are less bitter if harvested before they emerge from the soil and then parboiled in water[183].","Paper is made from the culms[46, 61]. The canes are too arched for good poles and there is too small a volume for significant pulp production, in spite of good fibre dimensions[195]. The culms are up to 4cm in diameter[220].

The canes split easily and are fairly flexible - they are used as a source of weaving material for mats, baskets and other household goods[220, 272].

The plant makes a good screen or hedge[188, 200].","Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20Â°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Seed is rarely available.

Division in spring as new growth commences[220]. Take divisions with at least three canes in the clump, trying to cause as little root disturbance to the main plant as possible. Grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse in pots of a high fertility sandy medium. Mist the foliage regularly until plants are established. Plant them out into their permanent positions when a good root system has developed, which can take a year or more[200].

Branches often develop into rhizomatous offsets with long roots. These can be removed and potted up in late spring[220].",False,2,,False,0,(Lour.)Raeusch. ex Schult.&Schult.f.,True,E. Asia,Eastern Himalayas to southern China.,Asia

A tea made from the roots is cholagogue, emetic, febrifuge and purgative[4, 21, 46, 165, 222]. The fresh root is also considered to be antiseptic, astringent and laxative[4, 21, 46, 165, 222]. The infusion is used in the treatment of upper respiratory infections such as tonsillitis and pharyngitis, and is also valuable in treating infections of the chest, gastro-intestinal tract and skin[254].The plants antimicrobial and immune-stimulant properties combat lymphatic problems, when used with detoxifying herbs such as Arctium lappa it helps to reduce enlarged lymph nodes[254]. Wild indigo is frequently prescribed, along with Echinacea, in the treatment of chronic viral infections or chronic fatigue syndrome[254]. A decoction of the root soothes sore or infected nipples and infected skin conditions[254].

Brassica napus is an aggregate species, probably derived through cultivation. It is thought that crosses of Brassica oleracea subsp. oleracea with B. rapa gave rise to the subsp. B. napus pabularia, from which subsp. napus and subsp. rapifera and other cvs were derived[269]. The aggregate species includes forms with swollen edible roots (B. napus napobrassica, the garden swede), forms grown for their oil-rich seeds (B. napus napus, the oilseed rape), forms grown for their edible leaves (B. napus pabularia, the rape kales) whilst the form grown as a green manure is B. napus arvensis. All these forms are treated separately here.

The oil obtained from the seed is high in erucic acid and glucosinolates, both of which have anti-nutritional properties. Cultivars have been developed that have a low content of these items and are therefore suitable for food.

Quamash bulbs were a staple food of the N. American Indians[42, 92]. The tribes would move to the Quamash fields in the early autumn and, whilst some people harvested the bulbs, others would dig a pit, line it with boulders then fill it with wood and set fire to it. The fire would heat the boulders and the harvested bulbs would then be placed in the pit and the whole thing covered with earth and the bulbs left to cook slowly for 2 days. The pit would then be opened and the Indians would feast on the bulbs until they could no longer fit any more in their stomachs.

Many cultivars tolerate full sun, in fact one report says that the species flowers better in a sunny position[182] and another that the plant prefers a hot sunny position[188].

Plants are hardy to about -10Â°c[184]. Another report says that this species is very cold hardy if it is sheltered from cold winds[11].

Prefers a wet summer and a cool but not very frosty dry winter[200]. Another report says that the plant requires hot summers if it is to do well[260].

Plants are not very self-compatible, self-fertilized flowers produce few seeds and these are of low viability[200].

A very ornamental plant[1], it is closely allied to C. oleifera[11]. The cultivar 'Narumi-gata' (which is sometimes mistakenly called C. oleifera) is a very reliable shrub in Britain[11].

Plants resent root disturbance and are best planted out into their final positions whilst still young.

This species is cultivated in Asia for the oil in its seed, there are many named varieties mostly developed for their ornamental value[182]. The flowers have a delicate sweet perfume[245].","The oil obtained from the seed is edible if it is refined[46, 105, 142, 183]. It is said to be equal in quality to olive oil[2].

The leaves are mixed with tea to give it a pleasant aroma[2, 183].","A non-drying oil is obtained from the seed - used as a hair-dressing and textile oil[46, 61, 171, 177].

A green dye is obtained from the pink or red petals[168].

A decoction of the plant (could this refer to the oil in the seed??) is used as a soap substitute for washing oily clothes[178].

Plants can be used as a hedge. The cultivar 'Onigoromo' has been especially mentioned for this purpose[188].","Seed - can be sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse[113]. Stored seed should be pre-soaked for 24 hours in warm water and the hard covering around the micropyle should be filed down to leave a thin covering[78, 113, 138].

Camellia sinensis,Theaceae,Tea Plant,Shrub,E,4.0,2.5,8.0,"The tea plant is commonly used in Chinese herbalism, where it is considered to be one of the 50 fundamental herbs[218]. Modern research has shown that there are many health benefits to drinking tea, including its ability to protect the drinker from certain heart diseases. It has also been shown that drinking tea can protect the teeth from decay[254], because of the fluoride naturally occurring in the tea[K]. However, the tea also contains some tannin, which is suspected of being carcinogenic[269].

The leaves are cardiotonic, diuretic, expectorant, stimulant and astringent[4, 174, 192, 218, 240, 269]. They exert a decided influence over the nervous system, giving a feeling of comfort and exhilaration, but also producing an unnatural wakefulness when taken in large doses[4]. They are used internally in the treatment of diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis and gastro-enteritis[218, 238]. Tea is reportedly effective in clinical treatment of amoebic dysentery, bacterial dysentery, gastro-enteritis, and hepatitis. It has also been reported to have antiatherosclerotic effects and vitamin P activity[269]. Excessive use, however, can lead to dizziness, constipation, constipation, indigestion, palpitations and insomnia[238]. Externally, they are used as a poultice or wash to treat cuts, burns, bruises, insect bites, ophthalmia, swellings etc[218, 238, 257]. Only the very young leaves and leaf buds are used, these can be harvested throughout the growing season from plants over three years old and are dried for later use[238].

Teabags have been poulticed onto baggy or tired eyes, compressed onto headache, or used to bathe sunburn[269].",E. Asia - China?

Prefers the partial shade of a light woodland or a woodland clearing[166, 200]. Forms grown in this country are slow-growing[219]. Tea is reported to tolerate an annual precipitation of 70 to 310cm, an average annual temperature range of 14 to 27Â°C and a pH in the range of 4.5 to 7.3[269].

This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10Â°c[200]. It prefers a wet summer and a cool but not very frosty dry winter[200].

The fragrant flowers are very attractive to insects, particularly moths[219].

Plants are not very self-compatible, self-fertilized flowers produce few seeds and these are of low viability[200].

A very ornamental plant[1], it is widely cultivated in tropical and warm temperate areas for its leaves which are used to make China tea[1]. There are many named varieties[183] and new hardier forms are being produced in China for growing in colder areas of the country[260]. The Chinese form, known as 'HsÃ¼eh-ch'a', is said to grow in areas within the snow limit on the mountains of Lingchiangfu in Yunnan province[178].

The sub-species C. sinensis assamica. (Mast.)Kitam. is a larger plant, growing up to 17 metres tall. It is a more tropical form of the species, is intolerant of frost and does not succeed outdoors in Britain[11, 260].","The leaves are infused in hot water and used as the drink that is commonly known as tea. It is widely drunk in many areas of the world. Green tea is made from the steamed and dried leaves, whilst black tea (the form most commonly drunk in the west) is made from leaves that have been fermented and then dried[183, 238]. Tea contains polyphenols, these are antioxidants that help to protect the body against heart diseases, stroke and cancer[238]. It also contains the stimulant caffeine which, when taken in excess, can cause sleeplessness and irritability and also, through its action as a diuretic, act to remove nutrients from the body. Tea is also rich in tannin and is a possible cause of oesophageal cancer[238]. Cold tea is sometimes used as a soaking liquid to flavour dried fruit[238]. One report says that the leaves are used as a boiled vegetable[179]. The leaves contain about 25.7% protein, 6.5% fat, 40.8% carbohydrate, 5% ash, 3.3% caffeine, 12.9% tannin[179].

Terminal sprouts with 2-3 leaves are usually hand-plucked, 10 kg of green shoots (75-80% water) produce about 2.5 kg dried tea[269]. The bushes are plucked every 7-15 days, depending on the development of the tender shoots. Leaves that are slow in development always make a better flavoured product[269]. Various techniques are used to produce black teas, usually during July and August when solar heat is most intense. Freshly picked leaves are spread very thinly and evenly on trays and placed in the sun until the leaves become very flaccid, requiring 13 hours or more, depending on heat and humidity. Other types of black teas are made by withering the leaves, rolling them into a ball and allowing to ferment in a damp place for 3-6 hours, at which time the ball turns a yellowish copper colour, with an agreeable fruity one[269]. If this stage goes too far, the leaves become sour and unfit for tea. After fermenting, the ball is broken up and the leaves spread out on trays and dried in oven until leaves are brittle and have slight odour of tea[269]. Tea is then stored in air-tight tin boxes or cans. As soon as harvested, leaves are steamed or heated to dry the natural sap and prevent oxidation to produce green tea. Still soft and pliable after the initial treatment, the leaves are then rolled and subjected to further firing. Thus dried, the leaves are sorted into various grades of green tea[269].

The flowers are made into 'tempura' using the edible oil that is obtained from the seed[183].

A clear golden-yellow edible oil resembling sasanqua oil is obtained from the seed[183, 269]. The oil needs to be refined before it is eaten.

An essential oil distilled from the fermented dried leaves is used as a commercial food flavouring[238]. Tea extract is used as a flavour in alcoholic beverages, frozen dairy desserts, candy, baked goods, gelatines, and puddings[269].

Tea is a potential source of food colours (black, green, orange, yellow, etc.)[269].","An essential oil is distilled from the fermented and dried leaves[238]. It is used in perfumery and in commercial food flavouring[238].

A non-drying oil is obtained from the seeds. Refined teaseed oil, made by removing the free fatty acids with caustic soda, then bleaching the oil with Fuller's earth and a sprinkling of bone black, makes an oil suitable for use in manufacture of sanctuary or signal oil for burning purposes, and in all respects is considered a favourable substitute for rapeseed, olive, or lard oils. The oil is different from cottonseed, corn, or sesame oils in that it is a non-drying oil and is not subject to oxidation changes, thus making it very suitable for use in the textile industry; it remains liquid below -18deg.C[269].

A grey dye is obtained from the pink or red petals[168].

The leaves contain 13 - 18% tannin[223]. The leaves also contain quercetin, a dyestuff that, when found in other plants, is much used as a dye[223]. The quantity of quercetin is not given[K].

Wood - moderately hard, close and even grained. It is very good for walking sticks[158].","Seed - can be sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse[113].

Cannabis sativa,Cannabidaceae,Hemp,Annual,,2.5,0.800000012,9.0,"Hemp, or more appropriately cannabis since the form grown for fibre contains much less of the medicinally active compounds, has a very long history of medicinal use, though it is illegal to grow in many countries since the leaves and other parts of the plant are widely used as a narcotic drug[4]. The leaves and the resin that exudes from them are the parts mainly used, though all parts of the plant contain the active ingredients[4]. Cannabis contains a wide range of active ingredients, perhaps the most important of which is THC. The principal uses of the plant are as a pain-killer, sleep-inducer and reliever of the nausea caused by chemotherapy, whilst it also has a soothing influence in nervous disorders[4]. Although cannabis does not effect a cure for many of the problems it is prescribed to treat, it is a very safe and effective medicine for helping to reduce the symptoms of many serious diseases. For example, it relieves the MS sufferer of the distressing desire to urinate, even when the bladder is empty. As long as it is used regularly, it also greatly reduces the pressure in the eye to relieve the symptoms of glaucoma.

The whole plant is anodyne, anthelmintic, antiemetic, anti-inflammatory, antiperiodic, antispasmodic, cholagogue, diuretic, emollient, hypnotic, hypotensive, laxative, narcotic, ophthalmic and sedative[4, 7, 21, 46, 147, 176, 178, 192, 238, 243]. It  is used to relieve some of the unpleasant side effects suffered by people undergoing chemotherapy for cancer - in particular it is very effective in removing the feelings of nausea and indeed helps to create an appetite and positive attitude of mind which is so important to people undergoing this treatment[K]. It has also been found of use in the treatment of glaucoma[200, 222, 238] and relieves the distressing constant desire to urinate that is suffered by many people with multiple sclerosis. Given to patients suffering from AIDS, it helps them to put on weight[238]. Since it strongly increases the desire for food it has been found of benefit in treating anorexia nervosa. It is used externally as a poultice for corns, sores, varicose veins, gout and rheumatism[218, 238].

Few plants have a greater array of folk medicine uses. Cannabis has been used in the treatment of a wide range of conditions including alcohol withdrawal, anthrax, asthma, blood poisoning, bronchitis, burns, catarrh, childbirth, convulsions, coughs, cystitis, delirium, depression, diarrhoea, dysentery, dysmenorrhoea, epilepsy, fever, gonorrhoea, gout, inflammation, insomnia, jaundice, lockjaw, malaria, mania, menorrhagia, migraine, morphine withdrawal, neuralgia, palsy, rheumatism, scalds, snakebite, swellings, tetanus, toothache, uteral prolapse, and whooping cough[269].

The seed is anodyne, anthelmintic, demulcent, diuretic, emollient, emmenagogue, febrifuge, laxative, narcotic and tonic[218]. It is used to treat constipation caused by debility or fluid retention[238]. The seed is an important source of essential fatty acids and can be very helpful in the treatment of many nervous diseases.

A high content of very active antibacterial and analgesic substances has been found in the plant[240]. It has bactericidal effects on gram-positive micro-organisms, in some cases up to a dilution of 1:150,000[240].",W. Asia - Iran to India. A casual in Britain[17].,Fluvial deposits on crags and stony slopes[74]. It is occasionally found as a casual on waste ground in Britain[17].

Its action is almost entirely on the higher nerve centres, it can produce an exhilarating intoxication with hallucinations and is a widely used street drug[4]. It has also been widely used in the past by mystics and sages wanting to communicate with the higher forces of nature. The nature of its effect does depend much on the temperament of the individual[4]. The use of cannabis is considered to be less harmful than alcohol or tobacco by many people, nevertheless its use has been banned in many countries of the world including most western countries, New Zealand and Australia.",,"Cannabis is very adaptable to soil and climatic conditions[269]. It prefers a rich loamy soil with plenty of humus[171] but it succeeds in ordinary garden soil[1] and also in calcareous soils[171]. When grown for fibre, it requires a mild temperate climate with at least 67cm annual rainfall, with abundant rain whilst the seeds are germinating and until young plants become established[269]. Cannabis thrives on rich, fertile, neutral to slightly alkaline, well-drained silt or clay loams with moisture retentive subsoils, it does not grow well on acid, sandy soils[269]. Of the many types of hemp, some are adapted to most vegetated terrains and climates[269]. Cannabis is reported to tolerate an annual precipitation range of 30 to 400cm, an average annual temperature range of 6 to 27Â°C and a pH in the range of 4.5 to 8.2[269].

Plants require little cultivation, except for weeding during early stages of growth. Hemp grows rapidly and soon crowds out weeds[269]. After the plants are 20 cm tall, weeding is abandoned. Hemp tends to exhaust the soil of nutrients, though some nutrients are returned to the soil after plants are harvested[269].

Hemp is commonly cultivated for its fibre, edible seed and oil in many areas of the world, it is also a socially acceptable drug in areas of Asia and the Middle East[238]. However, it is illegal to grow in Britain and many other western countries (plus Australia and New Zealand) because it contains certain narcotic principles and is a commonly used narcotic drug[20, 123, 238].

As Cannabis sativa has been cultivated for over 4,500 years for different purposes, many varieties and cultivars have been selected for specific purposes, as fibre, oil or narcotics. Drug-producing selections grow better and produce more drug in the tropics; oil and fibre producing plants thrive better in the temperate and subtropical areas. Many of the cultivars and varieties have been named as to the locality where it is grown mainly. However, all so called varieties freely interbreed and produce various combinations of the characters. The form of the plant and the yield of fibre from it vary according to climate and particular variety. Varieties cultivated particularly for their fibres have long stalks, branch very little, and yield only small quantities of seed. Varieties which are grown for the oil from their seed are short in height, mature early and produce large quantities of seed. Varieties grown for the drugs are short, much-branched with smaller dark-green leaves. Between these three main types of plants are numerous varieties which differ from the main one in height, extent of branching and other characteristics[269]. At least one variety has been selected for its virtually insignificant content of the narcotic principles[141]. This form is monoecious whereas most other forms are dioecious[141]. There is also said to be a tall Chinese form that has no narcotic effect[179]. However in 1999 even these varieties are illegal to grow in Britain without a special licence. Certain varieties do not form many side-shoots and these are the forms most commonly grown for their fibre[123]. Plants grown in warmer climates tend to be best for medicinal use, whilst those grown in more northerly latitudes produce the better fibre[4].

The seed is very attractive to birds and is often included in bird seed mixtures[7].","Seed - raw or cooked. It can be parched and eaten as a condiment or made into cakes and fried[2, 85, 177, 183]. The seed is quite tasty, but it is very difficult to separate from the husk. We have tried grinding the seed, husk and all, and eating it this way, but it does then have a very gritty texture[K]. The seed contains about 27.1% protein, 25.6% fat, 7.4% carbohydrate, 6.1% ash[179]. A nutritional analysis is available calculated on a zero moisture basis[218].

A highly nutritious edible oil, rich in essential fatty acids, is obtained from the seed[105, 183].

Leaves. Used in soups[269]. The leaves contain 0.215% carotene[179].","A drying oil is obtained from the seed. It is used for lighting, soap making, paints, varnish etc[4, 7, 21, 46, 57, 171]. In the temperate zone, oil is produced from females which have been left to stand after the fibre-producing males have been harvested[269]. A varnish is made from the pressed seeds[269]. Seed is harvested from the female plants when most of it falls off when the plant is shaken. Best time of day to harvest seed is in early morning when fruits are turgid and conditions damp. As fruits dry out by mid-day, seed loss increases due to shattering. Usually stems are cut and the seeds shaken out over canvas sheets or beaten with sticks to extract the seeds[269].

A fibre is obtained from the stem. It is strong and very durable[171] and is used in making coarse fabrics, rope etc[1, 7, 21, 46, 57, 61]. Male plants produce the best fibres and they are harvested when the plants turn brown and the flowers begin to open[123, 171, 269]. When used for making paper the stems are harvested in the autumn and either retted or steamed until the fibres can be removed. The fibre is cooked for 2 hours or more with lye and then beaten in a ball mill or Hollander beater. The paper is off-white in colour[189].

Carthamnus tinctorius,Compositae,Safflower,Annual,,1.0,0.349999994,,"Safflower is commonly grown as a food plant, but also has a wide range of medicinal uses. Modern research has shown that the flowers contain a number of medically active constituents and can, for example, reduce coronary heart disease and lower cholesterol levels[254, 279].

Alterative, analgesic, antibacterial, antiphlogistic, haemopoietic[14, 174, 178]. Treats tumours and stomatitis[174].

The flowers are anticholesterolemic, diaphoretic, emmenagogue, laxative, purgative, sedative and stimulant[4, 7, 147, 176, 240, 269]. They are used to treat menstrual pains and other complications by promoting a smooth menstrual flow[218] and were ranked third in a survey of 250 potential anti-fertility plants[218]. In domestic practice, the flowers are used as a substitute or adulterant for saffron in treating infants complaints such as measles, fevers and eruptive skin complaints[4, 269]. Externally, they are applied to bruising, sprains, skin inflammations, wounds etc[238]. The flowers are harvested in the summer and can be used fresh or dried[238]. They should not be stored for longer than 12 months[238]. It is possible to carefully pick the florets and leave the ovaries behind so that seed can be produced, though this procedure is rather more time-consuming[238].

The plant is febrifuge, sedative, sudorific and vermifuge[218]. When combined with Ligusticum wallichii it is said to have a definite therapeutic effect upon coronary diseases[218].

The seed is diuretic, purgative and tonic[240]. It is used in the treatment of rheumatism[240] and tumours, especially inflammatory tumours of the liver[269].

The oil is charred and used to heal sores and treat rheumatism[240]. In Iran, the oil is used as a salve for treating sprains and rheumatism[269].",N. Africa - Egypt. A rare casual in Britain[17].,Poor dry soils in full sun.,LM,N,DM,True,False,ANB,False,True,False,,,,True,True,False,Insects,Y,None known,,"Succeeds in ordinary garden soil[1, 169]. Safflower thrives in heavy clays with good water-holding capacity, but will also grow satisfactorily in deep sandy or clay loams with good drainage[269]. It needs soil moisture from the time of planting until it is flowering[269]. It requires a well-drained soil and a position in full sun[138, 169, 238]. Safflower is reported to tolerate an annual precipitation of 20 to 137cm, an annual average temperature range of 6.3 to 27.5deg.C and a pH in the range of 5.4 to 8.2[269]. Plants are reported to tolerate bacteria, disease, drought, frost, fungus, high pH, phage, salt, sand, rust, virus and wind[269].

Safflower grows in the temperate zone in areas where wheat and barley do well, and grows slowly during periods of cool short days in early part of season. Seedlings can withstand temperatures lower than many species; however, varieties differ greatly in their tolerance to frost; in general, frost damages budding and flowering thus reducing yields and quality[269].

Safflower is a long-day plant, requiring a photoperiod of about 14 hours. It is shade and weed intolerant, will not grow as a weed because other wild plants overshadow it before it becomes established. It is about as salt tolerant as cotton, but less so than barley[269]. Safflower matures in from 110-150 days from planting to harvest as a spring crop, as most of it is grown, and from 200 or more days as an autumn-sown crop[269]. It should be harvested when the plant is thoroughly dried. Since the seeds do not shatter easily, it may be harvested by direct combining. The crop is allowed to dry in the fields before threshing[269].

Plants are self-fertile, though cross-pollination also takes place[269].

Plants have a sturdy taproot that can penetrate 2.5 metres into the soil[269].

Safflower has been grown for thousands of years for the dye that can be obtained from the flowers[238]. This is not much used nowadays, having been replaced by chemical dyes, but the plant is still widely cultivated commercially for its oil-rich seed in warm temperate and tropical areas of the world. There are many named varieties[174, 200]. A number of spineless cultivars have been developed, but at present these produce much lower yields of oil than the spiny varieties[269].

Safflower is unlikely to be a worthwhile crop in Britain since it only ripens its seed here in long hot summers. There is more chance of success in the drier eastern part of the country with its usually warmer summers, the cooler moister conditions in the west tend to act against the production of viable seed[K].","An edible oil is obtained from the seed. It contains a higher percentage of essential unsaturated fatty acids and a lower percentage of saturated fatty acids than other edible vegetable seed oils[269]. The oil, light coloured and easily clarified, is used in salad dressings, cooking oils and margarines[2, 4, 7, 34, 46, 183, 244, 269]. A very stable oil, it is said to be healthier than many other edible oils and its addition to the diet helps to reduce blood-cholesterol levels[238].

Seed - cooked. They can be roasted, or fried and eaten in chutneys[61, 105, 183, 269].

Tender young leaves and shoots - cooked or raw[105, 171, 177]. A sweet flavour,  they can be used as a spinach[179, 183]. A famine food, it is only used when all else fails[178].

An edible yellow and a red dye are obtained from the flowers[244]. The yellow is used as a saffron substitute to flavour and colour food[183, 244].

The (fried?) seeds are used as a curdling agent for plant milks etc[183].","The seed yields up to 40% of a drying oil[114], it is used for lighting, paint, varnishes, linoleum and wax cloths[57, 171, 269]. The oil can also be used as a diesel substitute[269]. It does not yellow with age[114]. When heated to 300Â°c for 2 hours and then poured into cold water, the oil solidifies to a gelatinous mass and is then used as a cement for glass, tiles, stones etc or as a substitute for 'plaster of Paris'. If the oil is heated to 307Â°c for 2Â½ hours, it suddenly becomes a stiff elastic solid by polymerization and can then be used in making waterproof cloth etc[114].

A yellow dye is obtained by steeping the flowers in water, it is used as a saffron substitute[2, 4, 7, 14, 171, 238].

A red dye can be obtained by steeping the flowers in alcohol[169, 171, 238].

Trees do not grow very well in Britain, requiring hotter summers than are normally experienced here in order to fruit and fully ripen their wood[200]. However, a tree at Cambridge botanical gardens was 20 metres tall in 1985. Trees are said to be hardy to about -12Â°c, the same report also says that they are hardy to zone 5[200], which would experience considerably lower temperatures than this. Trees are probably much hardier when grown in areas with hot summers. In the wild, trees grow best in areas where summer temperatures average 24 - 30Â°c and the humidity is high[229].

Often cultivated for its edible seed, there are some named varieties[183].

     'Carlson 3'. Early maturing, it is being trialled in Canada[183].

     'Devore'.  An early fruiting form with small nuts that have an excellent flavour[183].

     'Gibson'.  Precocious, protandrous, the nuts are of medium size with a good flavour[183].

     'Green Island'.  Amongst the hardiest of cultivars, it has been selected for nut size, flavour and productivity[183].

     'Mullahy'.  Hardy, precocious and very productive, it has ripened in Ontario[183]. Nuts are fairly large with an excellent flavour.

     'Voiles 2'. Usually ripens as far north as Ontario and New York[183].

Another report says that plants grow well in dry conditions and are drought tolerant[260]. Tolerates low light levels and can be grown in the home[200]. Requires a position sheltered from the wind and cold[166].

This species tolerates occasional short-lived lows down to about -10Â°c[200, 231]. It will not tolerate recurring bouts of freezing over several days, nor does it survive freezing of the root system[231]. Plants are hardy in the milder areas of Britain, succeeding from S. Hampshire south and westwards[1, 11, 59]. Plants growing outdoors at Kew fruited in October 1989[K].

Palms usually have deep penetrating root systems and generally establish best when planted out at a young stage. However, older plants are substantially more cold tolerant than juvenile plants[231]. In areas at the limit of their cold tolerance, therefore, it is prudent to grow the plants in containers for some years, giving them winter protection, and only planting them into their permanent positions when sheer size dictates[231]. Palms can also be transplanted even when very large. Although the thick fleshy roots are easily damaged and/or desiccated, new roots are generally freely produced. It is important to stake the plant very firmly to prevent rock, and also to give it plenty of water until re-established - removing many of the leaves can also help[231]. Another report says that this species dislikes root disturbance[132].

Some botanists recognise a sub-species C. humilis arborescens (Pers.)Steud. (a taller growing form) and a cultivar 'Nana' which is smaller than the type and suckers. It is likely that these are no more than phenotypes and that this variety of habit can be induced in cultivation, plants in stressful situations such as near the coast duplicating the 'Nana' form whilst plants in optimum conditions are more like sub-species arborescens[200].

Plants in the wild are usually found in poor soils and seldom exceed 1.5 metres tall. When grown in better soils in gardens, however, they can grow up to 5 metres tall[260].","Very young leaf buds are cooked as a vegetable[46, 61, 105, 183].

The seed produces a long root some time before a shoot appears above ground and it can be potted up at this time[164].

A tea made from the leaves and flowering tops is used as a remedy for diarrhoea, headache, fevers, catarrh, vomiting of blood, rheumatism etc[213, 222, 257]. The infusion has also been used to treat ringworm[257]. The leaves have also been used as a poultice for toothaches, sprains etc[238, 257].

A cold water infusion of the leaves has been used externally to counter the effect of poison ivy[213, 222, 257] and to bathe stings, minor haemorrhages etc[238].

Requires an acid well-drained soil of low to medium fertility in partial shade but tolerates full sun if the soil does not dry out in the summer[200]. Tolerates dry sandy soils when grown in the shade[200].

A very ornamental plant[1], it is hardy to at least -25Â°c[184, 200].

The crushed leaves are very aromatic[182], their scent is most noticeable in the early morning and the evening[238]. The scent increases when the leaves are dried[245].

This species is somewhat intolerant of root disturbance and should be planted out into its permanent position whilst small[238].

Suckering freely[184], this plant is well suited to clothing banks on soils of low fertility[200]. It has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil micro-organisms, these form nodules on the roots of the plants and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].","The young fruits are eaten as a pleasant nibble[55, 62, 183].

The aromatic leaves, fresh or dried, are used to make a palatable tea[55, 62, 102, 183]. The leaves are also used as a seasoning[183].","The leaves are used as a lining in baskets etc in order to preserve the fruit[55].

The crushed leaves repel insects[102]. They can be thrown onto a camp fire to keep mosquitoes away[257].

The dried leaves have been burnt as an incense[257].","Seed - it has a very tough seed coat and also contains germination inhibitors and so is very difficult to germinate[113]. It is probably best to harvest the seed 'green' (after the seed has fully developed but before it dries on the plant) and sow immediately in a cold frame. If the seed has been stored then soaking in hot water for 24 hours will leach out some of the inhibitors and also help to soften the seed coat. Scarification will also help as will a period of cold stratification. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle.

Cornus officinalis,Cornaceae,Shan Zhu Yu,Shrub,D,10.0,10.0,6.0,"Shan Zhu Yu has been used for at least 2,000 years in Chinese herbal medicine. It is a herb that ""stabilizes and binds"" and is used principally to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding and unusually active secretions including copious sweating, excessive urine, spermatorrhoea and premature ejaculation[147, 238, 254]. Like all herbs that suppress bodily fluids (even excessive ones), it will simply prolong or lead to a worsening of symptoms if it is used without tonic or detoxifying herbs[254]. It is, therefore, normally used in combination with herbs such as Rehmannia glutinosa and is an ingredient of the ""Pill of eight ingredients"" which is used in China to ""warm up and invigorate the yang of the loins""[254].

The fruit is antibacterial, antifungal, hypotensive, antitumor, astringent, diuretic, hepatic and tonic[116, 147, 176, 178, 238].

Crocus sativus,Iridaceae,Saffron,Corm,,0.100000001,0.100000001,6.0,"Saffron is a famous medicinal herb with a long history of effective use, though it is little used at present because cheaper and more effective herbs are available[4, 7, 254]. The flower styles and stigmas are the parts used, but since these are very small and fiddly to harvest they are very expensive and consequently often adulterated by lesser products[7].

The styles and stigmas are anodyne, antispasmodic, aphrodisiac, appetizer, carminative, diaphoretic, emmenagogue, expectorant, sedative and stimulant[4, 7, 21, 174, 176, 218]. They are used as a diaphoretic for children, to treat chronic haemorrhages in the uterus of adults, to induce menstruation, treat period pains and calm indigestion and colic[4, 254]. A dental analgesic is obtained from the stigmas[7]. The styles are harvested in the autumn when the plant is in flower and are dried for later use[4], they do not store well and should be used within 12 months[238]. This remedy should be used with caution[21], large doses can be narcotic[240] and quantities of 10g or more can cause an abortion[218].",S. Europe - Greece to W.

The plant is perfectly safe in normal usage but 5 - 10 grams of saffron has been known to cause death[65].,,"Prefers a well-drained sandy or loamy soil that is free from clay[137]. Prefers a sunny position[238]. Grows well on calcareous soils[27] and on hot sheltered stony banks[42].

Plants are very frost hardy[137]. They also thrive in areas with poor summers, though they usually fail to flower in such conditions[238].

Plants produce less saffron when grown on rich soils[137]. They do not flower very freely in Britain[90].

Saffron has been cultivated for over 4,000 years for the edible dye obtained from the flower stigmas[1]. It was at one time commercially grown in Britain and the town Saffron Walden obtained its name because of this. There is at least one named form. 'Cashmirianus' comes from Kashmir and has large high quality corms. It yields about 27 kilos of rich orange stigmas per hectare[183].

When inhaled near to, the flowers have a delicate perfume[245]. Unlike most members of this genus, the flowers do not close of a night time or in dull weather[245]. The flowers are only produced after hot, dry summers[245].

Plants tend to move considerably from their original planting place because of their means of vegetative reproduction, it is therefore wise not to grow different species in close proximity[1].

Any planting out is best done in late spring or early summer[245].

Plants take 4 - 5 years to come into flowering from seed.","The flower styles are commonly used as a flavouring and yellow colouring for various foods such as bread, soups, sauces, rice and puddings[2, 4, 7, 14, 21, 27, 34, 183]. They are an essential ingredient of many traditional dishes such as paella, bouillabaisse, risotto milanese and various other Italian dishes[244]. The styles are extremely rich in riboflavin[137]. Water soluble[171]. Yields per plant are extremely low, about 4000 stigmas yield 25g of saffron[89]. Saffron is the world's most expensive spice, it takes 150,000 flowers and 400 hours work to produce 1 kilo of dried saffron[238]. About 25 kilos of styles can be harvested from a hectare of the plant[4]. Fortunately, only very small quantities of the herb are required to impart their colour and flavour to dishes[244]. Because of the cost, saffron is frequently adulterated with cheaper substitutes such as marigold flowers and safflower[244].

The flower styles are used as a tea substitute[183].

Root - cooked[183]. The corms are toxic to young animals[218] so this report of edibility should be treated with some caution[K].","The yellow dye obtained from the stigmas has been used for many centuries to colour cloth[4, 7, 14, 21]. It is the favoured colouring for the cloth of Indian swamis who have renounced the material world.

A blue or green dye is obtained from the petals[168].","Seed - according to some reports this species is a sterile triploid and so does not produce fertile seed[90, 238]. However, if seed is obtained then it is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[1]. Stored seed can be sown in the spring in a cold frame[1]. Germination can take 1 - 6 months at 18Â°c[164]. Unless the seed has been sown too thickly, do not transplant the seedlings in their first year of growth, but give them regular liquid feeds to make sure they do not become deficient. Divide the small bulbs once the plants have died down, planting 2 - 3 bulbs per 8cm pot. Grow them on for another 2 years in a greenhouse or frame and plant them out into their permanent positions when dormant in late summer[K]. It takes 3 years for plants to flower from seed[244].

The flower buds are a bitter acrid herb that is used to control coughs. The buds are anticoagulant, antiseptic, antitussive, antiviral, diuretic, purgative and stomachic[147, 174, 175, 176, 178, 218].

Skin contact with the sap can cause dermatitis in some people[200].,D. fortunei. Lindl.,"There is some disagreement over whether this species needs an acid or alkaline soil. According to some reports it requires a lime-free porous soil and semi-shade[1, 200] whilst another report says that it is probably best in a deep rubbly well-drained soil in a warm corner and kept well watered in a dry growing season[11]. Yet another report says that it grows best in a neutral to alkaline soil in sun or semi-shade[238]. A good sandy loam suits most members of this genus[11].

Plants are hardy to about -20Â°c, but they are short-lived and difficult to grow in cultivation in Britain[11, 184]. This might be because our summers are not warm enough for the plants to develop properly[11, 184], they seem to be fully hardy after hot summers[188]. It is tricky to get this plant to flower because the buds are formed in the autumn on wood of that year's growth and they may not survive our variable winters[11, 182].

Produces suckers when growing in its native habitat.

Plants are best grown on their own roots, grafted plants tend to be unsatisfactory.

Plants are resentful of root disturbance and should be planted into their permanent positions as soon as possible[188].",None known,None known,"Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe with the pot sealed in a polythene bag to hold in the moisture. Remove this bag as soon as germination takes place[164]. The seed usually germinates better if it is harvested 'green' (when it has fully developed but before it dries on the plant) and sown immediately. Germination should normally take place by spring, though it sometimes takes a further year. Stored seed is more problematic. It should be warm stratified for 8 - 12 weeks at 20Â°c followed by 12 - 14 weeks at 3Â°c. Germination may still take another 12 months or more at 15Â°c[164].

The fruit is said to have different properties depending on its stage of ripeness, though it is generally antitussive, astringent, laxative, nutritive and stomachic[218, 238].

The fresh fully ripe fruit is used raw in the treatment of constipation and haemorrhoids[238] and when cooked is used to treat diarrhoea[238]..

Dormant plants are quite hardy in Britain, tolerating temperatures down to about -14Â°c[74], but they require warmer summers than are normally experienced in Britain in order to ripen their fruit and wood[3]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. A warm sunny wall improves the chance of producing ripe fruit[3] and trees fruit freely when grown under glass[1]. Fruits are frequently produced outdoors at Kew[11, K]. A tree seen in a open position with afternoon shade at Kew in November 1993 (after a cool summer) had about 200 almost ripe fruits around 8cm in diameter[K]. The same tree, after a fairly warm summer in 1996, had a large quantity of fruit just about ready for harvesting in the middle of December[K].

Trees produce a long taproot and should be planted out into their permanent positions as soon as possible[200]. The young trees require some winter protection for their first winter or two[K].

The persimmon is widely cultivated for its edible fruit in warm temperate areas of the world, especially in Japan and China, there are many named varieties[183]. Some cultivars, such as 'Fuyu', lack the usual astringency and can be eaten whilst still firm, though they develop a richer flavour if allowed to become soft[183, 200]. These non-astringent forms require a warmer climate and do not ripen in cooler areas[183]. The astringent cultivars are somewhat hardier and ripen well in cooler climates than the non-astringent forms[183]. The fruit colours better and is sweeter in warmer areas but in hot conditions has a poor texture and deep black spots develop[183]. If allowed to become very ripe (almost to the point of going rotten), they develop a better flavour than non-astringent forms[183].

Dioecious, but the female tree can produce seedless fruits in the absence of a pollinator. However, unfertilized fruit tends to be smaller and more astringent[200]. This astringency is due to the high content of tannin but once the fruit is fully ripe it loses this astringency and becomes sweet[132]. If fertilized fruit is required, then growing one male for every 8 - 10 females is usually adequate[238].","Fruit - raw or cooked[1, 2, 3, 7, 46, 61]. The fruit has an exquisitely rich flavour when it is very soft and fully ripe (almost at the point of going bad), but the fruit of many cultivars is very harsh and astringent before then[K]. In Britain, the fruit needs to be harvested whilst it is still very hard. This is done very late in the season (in December or even January if possible), it is then stored in a cool but frost-free place until very soft and fully ripe[K]. The fruit can also be used in pies, cakes, bread, desserts etc[183]. It contains 25% sugars[74]. A fuller nutritional analysis is available[218]. The fruit can also be dried for later use[183]. The fruit is about 7.5cm in diameter[200].

This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200].

Plants flower quite frequently in Britain and often produce viable seed[11]. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122].

This species is not very hardy in Britain though it experiences frosts in the wild[167]. Another report says that it can tolerate temperatures down to about -8Â°c[260]. It might be worthwhile trying it outdoors in the mildest areas of the country.

Eucalyptus species have not adopted a deciduous habit and continue to grow until it is too cold for them to do so. This makes them more susceptible to damage from sudden cold snaps. If temperature fluctuations are more gradual, as in a woodland for example, the plants have the opportunity to stop growing and become dormant, thus making them more cold resistant. A deep mulch around the roots to prevent the soil from freezing also helps the trees to survive cold conditions[200]. The members of this genus are remarkably adaptable however, there can be a dramatic increase in the hardiness of subsequent generations from the seed of survivors growing in temperate zones[200].

Eucalyptus monocultures are an environmental disaster, they are voracious, allelopathic and encourage the worst possible attitudes to land use and conservation[200].

Plants are shallow-rooting and, especially in windy areas, should be planted out into their permanent positions when small to ensure that they do not suffer from wind-rock[245].

The bark is especially useful in the treatment of biliousness and liver disorders which follow or accompany fevers[4, 254] and for treating various skin disorders such as eczema which could arise from poor liver and gallbladder function[254]. It is also used as a tea in the treatment of malaria, liver congestion, constipation etc[222]. The powdered bark, applied to the scalp, was believed to eliminate dandruff[222].

The bark and the root contain digitoxin and have a digitalis-like effect on the heart[213, 222]. They have been used in the treatment of heart conditions[254].

A heavy wet soil tends to encourage excessive plant growth at the expense of fruit production[1]. Prefers a very sunny position but tolerates part-day shade when grown on a warm wall[202].

Plants are hardy to about -15Â°c[202]. The top growth is susceptible to frost damage and can be killed back to the base in severe winters, though plants usually recover well[3]. Trees require the protection of a south or west facing wall in most parts of Britain if they are to produce a worthwhile crop[3, 219], though free standing trees can succeed in Cornwall[59]. There is a small orchard of free-standing trees in Anthony garden near Plymouth. These were seen in July 1995 with a very heavy crop of ripening fruits that would have been ready by August[K].

Figs are very widely cultivated in warmer climes than Britain for their edible fruit, there are many named varieties[183]. 'Brown Turkey' is the cultivar most commonly grown in Britain and is probably the most suitable for this climate. 'White Ischia' is a dwarf cultivar (though it can still be 5 metres tall and wide) and is ideal for pot culture[238]. It produces an abundance of green-white thin-skinned fruits[238].

Up to three crops of fruit a year can be obtained in some countries[46]. When grown outdoors in Britain only one crop is usually obtained, though in exceptionally hot years two crops are sometimes produced. The fruit usually takes about 12 months to mature in Britain, baby fruits no larger than about 15mm long in the autumn usually overwinter to form the following years crop of fruit.

If plants are grown in pots in a conservatory or cold greenhouse, two crops of fruit can be obtained, one in early summer and one in late summer to autumn[260]. Pinch back the new shoots to about six leaves in order to encourage the second crop[260].

It is a good idea to restrict the roots of fig trees on most soil types in order to discourage excessive vegetative growth at the expense of fruit production[3]. This can be done by root pruning, but it is easier to place some kind of permanent restriction around the roots - planting into a large tub that is then buried into the ground is one method. It is important to make sure that the tree still gets ample moisture, especially when the fruits are ripening.","Fruit - raw or cooked[1, 3, 3, 4, 46].

This species is closely related to the common fig, Ficus carica, and is not perhaps specifically distinct. It has been recommended for growing in areas where the climate is too wet for common figs since it fruits during the monsoon season in the Himalayas. However, it probably requires the fig-wasp in order to pollinate the flowers and so is unlikely to fruit in areas such as Britain that are too cold for the fig-wasp to survive.

Ginkgo biloba,Ginkgoaceae,Maidenhair Tree,Tree,D,30.0,9.0,4.0,"Ginkgo has a long history of medicinal use in traditional Chinese medicine, where the seed is most commonly used. These uses are mentioned in more detail later. Recent research into the plant has discovered a range of medicinally active compounds in the leaves and this has excited a lot of interest in the health-promoting potential of the plant[237]. In particular, the leaves stimulate the blood circulation and have a tonic effect on the brain, reducing lethargy, improving memory and giving an improved sense of well-being[237]. They have also been shown to be effective in improving peripheral arterial circulation[218, 237] and in treating hearing disorders such as tinnitus where these result from poor circulation or damage by free radicals[237]. The leaves contain ginkgolides, these are compounds that are unknown in any other plant species[238]. Ginkgolides inhibit allergic responses and so are of use in treating disorders such as asthma[238]. Eye disorders and senility have also responded to treatment[237]. The leaves are best harvested in the late summer or early autumn just before they begin to change colour. They are dried for later use[237, 238].

The fruit is antibacterial, antifungal, astringent, cancer, digestive, expectorant, sedative, vermifuge[117, 147, 176, 178].

The fruit is macerated in vegetable oil for 100 days and then the pulp is used in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, asthma, bronchitis etc[218]. (This report might be referring to the seed rather than the fleshy fruit[K]).

The cooked seed is antitussive, astringent and sedative[218]. It is used in the treatment of asthma, coughs with thick phlegm and urinary incontinence[176, 238]. The raw seed is said to have anticancer activity and also to be antivinous[176, 218]. It should be used with caution, however, due to reports of toxicity[176, 218].

The cooked seeds stabilize spermatogenesis[176].",E. Asia - N.

It is therefore best to cook the seed before eating it to ensure any possible toxicity is destroyed. This acrimonious principle is probably 4'-methoxypyridoxine, which can destroy vitamin B6[237]. It is more toxic for children, but the raw nuts would have to be eaten often over a period of time for the negative effects to become apparent[237].",Salisburia adiantifolia.,"Succeeds in most soil types so long as they are well-drained[117, 200, 202], though it prefers a rather dry loam in a position sheltered from strong winds[11]. Some of the best specimens in Britain are found growing on soils over chalk or limestone[185]. Plants flower and fruit more reliably after hot summers or when grown in a warm sunny position[202]. Established plants are drought resistant[117], they also tolerate atmospheric pollution[117, 200]. Plants can grow in poor hard-packed soil, making the male forms good candidates for street planting[229]. Trees are often used for street planting in towns, only the males are used because the fruit from female plants has a nauseous smell. The fruit contains butanoic acid, it has the aroma of rancid butter[200].

Ginkgo is a very ornamental plant[1, 117] and there are several named forms[11, 200]. This species is the only surviving member of a family that was believed to be extinct until fairly recent times. It has probably remained virtually unchanged for at least 150 million years and might have been growing when the dinosaurs were roaming the earth[237]. It is exceptional in having motile sperm[185] and fertilization may not take place until after the seed has fallen from the tree[81]. This genus belongs to a very ancient order and has affinities with tree ferns and cycads[185].

The ginkgo is usually slow growing, averaging less than 30cm per year with growth taking place from late May to the end of August[185]. Growth is also unpredictable, in some years trees may not put on any new growth whilst in others there may be 1 metre of growth[185]. This variability does not seem to be connected to water or nutrient availability. Trees are probably long-lived in Britain, one of the original plantings (in 1758) is still growing and healthy at Kew (1993).

Plants are not troubled by insects or diseases[132, 200], have they evolved a resistance?[132].

Ginkgo is a popular food and medicinal crop in China, the plants are often cultivated for this purpose and are commonly grown in and around temples.

Plants are either male or female, one male plant can pollinate up to 5 females. It takes up to 35 years from seed for plants to come into bearing[117]. Prior to maturity the sexes can often be distinguished because female plants tend to have almost horizontal branches and deeply incised leaves whilst males have branches at a sharper angle to the trunk and their leaves are not so deeply lobed[132]. Branches of male trees can be grafted onto female frees in order to fertilize them. When a branch from a female plant was grafted onto a male plant at Kew it fruited prolifically[11]. Female trees have often been seen in various gardens with good crops of fruit[K].

Seeds are marked by two or three longitudinal ridges, it is said that those with two ridges produce female plants whilst those with three ridges produce male plants[178].

Trees can be coppiced[200]. They can also be pruned into a fan-shape for growing on walls[202]. Another report says that the trees dislike pruning and will often die back as a result[238].","Seed - raw (in small quantities), or cooked[237]. A soft and oily texture[229], the seed has a sweet flavour[2, 63] and tastes somewhat like a large pine nut[237]. The baked seed makes very pleasant eating, it has a taste rather like a cross between potatoes and sweet chestnuts[K]. The seed can be boiled and used in soups, porridges etc[183, 237]. It needs to be heated before being eaten in order to destroy a mildly acrimonious principle[57]. Another report says that the seed can be eaten raw[132] whilst another says that large quantities of the seed are toxic[218]. See the notes above on toxicity for more details[237]. The raw seed is said to have a fish-like flavour[218]. The seed is rich in niacin[160]. It is a good source of starch and protein, but is low in fats[237].

A very astringent herb, it is commonly used in the West and is widely available from both herbalists and chemists[222]. It is an important ingredient of proprietary eye drops, skin creams, ointments and skin tonics[238]. It is widely used as an external application to bruises, sore muscles, varicose veins, haemorrhoids, sore nipples, inflammations etc[238].

The bark is astringent, haemostatic, sedative and tonic[4, 14, 21, 165, 171, 222]. Tannins in the bark are believed to be responsible for its astringent and haemostatic properties[222]. Bottled witch hazel water is a steam distillate that does not contain the tannins from the shrub[222], this is less effective in its action than a tincture[238].

The bark is used internally in the treatment of diarrhoea, colitis, dysentery, haemorrhoids, vaginal discharge, excessive menstruation, internal bleeding and prolapsed organs[238].

Branches and twigs are harvested for the bark in the spring[238].

An infusion of the leaves is used to reduce inflammations, treat piles, internal haemorrhages and eye inflammations[213]. The leaves are harvested in the summer and can be dried for later use[238].

Scarification may also improve germination of stored seed[80]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. Overwinter them in a greenhouse for their first winter and plant out in late spring[78].

The leaves and fruits contain the saponic glycoside hederagenin which, if ingested, can cause breathing difficulties and coma[274].

The sap can cause dermatitis with blistering and inflammation.

This species is not hardy in all parts of Britain, tolerating temperatures down to about -5 to -10Â°c[200].

Ivy is a rampant climbing plant, clinging by means of aerial roots and often trailing on the ground in woods and hedges[186]. It is of benefit rather than harm when growing on a wall because it keeps the wall dry and acts as an insulation[11, 24]. It does not damage the structure of a wall. Similarly, it does not harm large trees when climbing into them, though it can shade out smaller and ailing trees[200]. It is not a parasitic plant, but instead obtains all its nutrient from the sun and the soil[186].

Plants are more productive when grown in a rich soil[1, 37, 38]. Heavy soils produce the highest yields, but the tubers are easily damaged at harvest-time so lighter well-drained sandy loams are more suitable[200]. Dislikes shade[1]. Likes some lime in the soil[16]. Jerusalem artichoke is reported to tolerate an annual precipitation of 31 to 282cm, an average annual temperature of 6.3 to 26.6Â°C and a pH in the range of 4.5 to 8.2[269].

Jerusalem artichokes were cultivated as a food plant by the N. American Indians and they are today often grown in temperate areas for their edible tubers. There are some named varieties[4, 46, 183, 200]. The plant is a suitable crop in any soil and climate where corn (Zea mays) will grow. It survives in poor soil and in areas as cold as Alaska. It also tolerates hot to sub-zero temperatures[269]. The first frost kills the stems and leaves, but the tubers can withstand freezing for months[269]. The plants are particularly suited to dry regions and poor soils where they will out-yield potatoes[200]. Tuber production occurs in response to decreasing day-length in late summer[200]. Yields range from 1 - 2kg per square metre[200]. The tubers are very cold-tolerant and can be safely left in the ground in the winter to be harvested as required. They can be attacked by slugs, however, and in sites prone to slug damage it is probably best to harvest the tubers in late autumn and store them over the winter. It is almost impossible to find all the tubers at harvest time, any left in the soil will grow away vigorously in the spring.

Plants do not flower in northern Europe. They are sensitive to day-length hours, requiring longer periods of light from seedling to maturation of plant, and shorter periods for tuber formation. They do not grow where day-lengths vary little[269].

The plant is good weed eradicator, it makes so dense a shade that few other plants can compete[269].

The young growth is extremely attractive to slugs, plants can be totally destroyed by them[K].

Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233].

Plants only produce flowers in Britain after a long hot summer[17] and seed is rarely formed[200]. 

Grows well with corn[20].

Plants can be invasive[1].","Tubers - raw or cooked[2, 46, 61, 95]. The tuber develops a pleasant sweetness during the winter, especially if subjected to frosts, and is then reasonably acceptable raw[K]. Otherwise it is generally best cooked, and can be used in all the ways that potatoes are used[K]. The tubers are rich in inulin[46], a starch which the body cannot digest, so Jerusalem artichokes provide a bulk of food without many calories[K]. Some people are not very tolerant of inulin, it tends to ferment in their guts and can cause quite severe wind[K]. The tubers are fairly large, up to 10cm long and 6cm in diameter[200]. The tubers bruise easily and lose moisture rapidly so are best left in the ground and harvested as required[200].

The inulin from the roots can be converted into fructose, a sweet substance that is safe for diabetics to use[46, 171].

The roasted tubers are a coffee substitute[183].","The plants are a good source of biomass. The tubers are used in industry to make alcohol etc[141]. The alcohol fermented from the tubers is said to be of better quality than that from sugar beets[269].

A fast-growing plant, Jerusalem artichokes can be grown as a temporary summer screen[200]. Very temporary, it is July before they reach a reasonable height and by October they are dying down[K].","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.

Division in spring or autumn[200]. Harvest the tubers in late autumn or the winter and either replant the tubers immediately or store them in a cool but frost-free place and plant them out in early spring. Jerusalem artichoke is propagated by tubers, which should be planted as early as possible in the spring when the soil can be satisfactorily worked[269]. Late planting usually reduces tuber yields and size seriously. Whole tubers or pieces about 50 g (2 oz.) should be planted like potatoes and covered to a depth of 10 cm. Pieces larger than 50 g do not increase the yield, though those smaller will decrease it. Deeper planting may delay emergence, weaken the sprouts, and cause the tubers to develop deeper, making harvest more difficult[269].

There has been much confusion over this species and many plants cultivated under this name have proved to be different species[214].

Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened.

In the Nineteenth century it acquired a reputation as a heal-all and was grossly over-collected from the wild and has become rare in the east of its range[213, 222]. It is now being cultivated on a small scale[4]. It is especially valued in treating disorders of the digestive system and mucous membranes and is also extremely useful in the treatment of habitual constipation[4, 254].  See also the notes above on cultivation needs[K].

The root is the active part of the plant, it is harvested in the autumn after the plant has died down and is dried for later use[4, 213]. It is said to be antiperiodic, antiseptic, astringent, cholagogue, diuretic, laxative, stomachic, tonic[4, 21, 46, 165, 222, 238]. It is used mainly in the treatment of disorders affecting the ears, eyes, throat, nose, stomach, intestines and vagina[254].

The root contains the alkaloids hydrastine, berberine and canadine[213]. Berberine is antibacterial (effective against broad-spectrum bacteria and protozoa[207]), it increases bile secretions, acts as an anticonvulsant, a mild sedative and lowers blood pressure[222]. Use of this plant destroys beneficial intestinal organisms as well as pathogens, so it should only be prescribed for limited periods (a maximum of three months)[238]. The plant should be used with caution, and not at all during pregnancy or by people with high blood pressure[222, 238].

Plants produce a deep taproot and they are intolerant of root disturbance[1, 11]. Seedlings should be planted out into their permanent positions as soon as possible and given some protection since they are somewhat tender when young[1, 11].

Flower initiation depends upon suitable conditions in the previous summer[200]. The flowers and young growths can be destroyed by even short periods down to -2Â°c, but fortunately plants are usually late coming into leaf[200].

Any pruning should only be carried out in late summer to early autumn or when the plant is fully dormant otherwise wounds will bleed profusely and this will severely weaken the tree[200].

Trees have a dense canopy which tends to reduce plant growth below them.

The leaves of many species also secrete substances that have an inhibitory affect on plants growing underneath them. All in all this is not a very good companion plant[K].

Closely related to J. major, and hybridizes with that species where their ranges overlap[229].","Seed - raw. The seed is sweet and oily but it is rather small and has a thick shell[2, 62, 105, 183, 227]. The seed is the smallest of this genus[82].

An edible oil is obtained from the seed, it tends to go rancid quickly.","Sometimes used as a rootstock[183].

Plants produce chemicals which can inhibit the growth of other plants. These chemicals are dissolved out of the leaves when it rains and are washed down to the ground below, reducing the growth of plants under the tree[18, 20, 159]. The roots of many members of this genus produce substances that are toxic to many plant species, especially apples (Malus species), members of the Ericaceae, Potentilla spp and the white pines (certain Pinus spp.)[200].

Wood - heavy, hard, not strong. It makes a beautiful veneer and has been very over-exploited in the wild for this purpose[82]. It is also used in cabinet making, furniture etc[82, 149].","The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in individual deep pots in a cold frame[80]. You need to protect it from mice, birds, squirrels etc. The seed usually germinates in late winter or the spring. Plant out the seedlings into their permanent positions in early summer and give some protection from the cold for their first winter or two.

The seed can also be stored in cool moist conditions (such s the salad compartment of a fridge) over the winter and sown in early spring but it may then require a period of cold stratification before it will germinate[78, 80, 113].",False,2,,False,0,Berl.,True,South-western N.

Especially useful in the treatment of skin diseases, black walnut is of the highest value in curing scrofulous diseases, herpes, eczema etc[4]. An infusion of the bark is used to treat diarrhoea and also to stop the production of milk, though a strong infusion can be emetic[21, 257]. The bark is chewed to allay the pain of toothache and it is also used as a poultice to reduce the pain of headaches[222, 257].

The juice from the fruit husk is applied externally as a treatment for ringworm[222, 257]. The husk is chewed in the treatment of colic and applied as a poultice to inflammations[222].

The burnt kernels, taken in red wine, are said to prevent falling hair, making it fair[269].

Green husks are supposed to ease the pain of toothache[269].

A tea made from the leaves is astringent[222]. An infusion has been used to lower high blood pressure[257]. It can be used as a cleansing wash[21]. The pulverized leaves have been rubbed on the affected parts of the body to destroy ringworm[257].

The oil from the ripe seeds has been used externally in the treatment of gangrene, leprosy, and wounds[269].

Prefers a slightly alkaline soil[200]. Plants are best suited to deep, rich, slightly acid or neutral soil, with good drainage, but will not succeed on infertile upland soil or on soils with poor drainage[269]. The black walnut grows best areas with an annual precipitation from 30 to 130cm, an annual temperature in the range of 7 to 19Â°C and a pH from 4.9 - 8.2[269].

The dormant plant is very cold hardy, but the young growth in spring, however, can be damaged by late frosts.

The Black walnut is one of most valuable natural forest trees in the United States[269]. A very ornamental and fast growing plant[1, 200], it is sometimes cultivated in N. America for its edible seed. Whilst potential yields of 7.5 tonnes per hectare have been postulated, it is more feasible to expect annual yields of around 2.5 tonnes per hectare[269]. Good seed crops are usually produced every other year, though some plants fruit well annually whilst others produce god crops every third year[269]. The average weight of a seed from wild trees is about 17g, though there are many named varieties and the weight of their seeds varies from 20 - 30g[183, 269]. There are breeding programmes that are seeking to develop cultivars with thinner shells[226].

Trees in the wild commence bearing seeds when about 12 years old[227].  Black walnut trees mature their fruit rather generally throughout the plants natural range where there is a growing season of about 150 days and an average summer temperature of 16.5Â°C[269]. Trees do not fruit very freely in Britain unfortunately[1, 11]. They grow well in the eastern half of the country but often do not thrive in the west[98]. Trees have been extensively planted for timber in parts of C. and E. Europe[50].

This species hybridizes with J. regia[149], some named cultivars have been developed from this cross for their seed.

Plants produce a deep taproot which makes them very drought resistant when established, though they are intolerant of root disturbance[1, 11, 269]. Seedlings should be planted out into their permanent positions as soon as possible and given some protection for their first winter or two since they are somewhat tender when young[1, 11].

Flower initiation depends upon suitable conditions in the previous summer[200]. The flowers and young growths can be destroyed by even short periods down to -2Â°c, but fortunately plants are usually late coming into leaf[200].

The black walnut is self-fertile, but the sequence of male and female blooming, called dichogamy, can and often does minimize chances of a tree shedding pollen on its own pistils. In different trees pollen may be shed before the receptivity period of female flowers, or at same time, or after pistil receptivity. For greatest possible nut production, plant trees of 2 or more cvs, as different cvs have overlapping pollen-receptivity periods and can pollinate each other[269].

Any pruning should only be carried out in late summer to early autumn or when the plant is fully dormant otherwise wounds will bleed profusely and this will severely weaken the tree[200].

Plants produce chemicals which can inhibit the growth of other plants. These chemicals are dissolved out of the leaves when it rains and are washed down to the ground below, reducing the growth of plants under the tree[18, 20, 159]. The roots also produce substances that are toxic to many plant species, especially apples (Malus species), members of the Ericaceae, Potentilla spp and the white pines (certain Pinus spp.)[200]. Beans, peas and tomatoes are also particularly sensitive to these secretions and will not grow in the rooting zone[200]. Trees cast quite a dense shade so, along with their other anti-social tendencies, are not very friendly trees for a woodland garden[K].

The bruised leaves have a pleasant sweet though resinous smell[245].","Seed - raw or cooked. A sweet, rich distinctive delicious flavour it makes an excellent dessert nut and is also widely used in confections, cakes etc[2, 34, 82, 183]. The kernel is hard to extract and the oil it contains quickly turns rancid[101, 159]. The unripe fruits can be pickled[183]. The seed is borne in solitary fruits or in pairs and is 3 - 4cm in diameter[82, 229]. The nuts can leave a permanent stain on clothing[226].

An edible oil is obtained from the seed[101, 183]. A sweet taste but it tends to go rancid quickly[159]. Used as a seasoning in bread, squash and other foods[183].

The tree yields a sweet sap that can be drunk or concentrated into syrup or sugar[101, 102, 183]. It is tapped in spring.","A brown dye is obtained from the nuts, husks and bark[14, 57, 101, 159]. It does not require a mordant[169]. The husks can be dried for later use[169].

A brown dye is obtained from the leaves and stems[168]. It does not require a mordant[168]. The dye turns black if it is prepared in an iron pot[168]. The leaves can be dried for later use[169].

The husks are rich in tannin[226].

The green fruit husks can be boiled to provide a yellow dye[269].

The husks can be made into a high quality coal (does the report mean charcoal?[K]) and is then used as a filter[226]. It was used in gas masks[226].

The woody shells on the fruits have been used to make jewellery[269].

Insects are said to avoid the walnut tree, hence it is often used as a poor man's insect repellent. When rubbed on faces, walnut leaves are said to repel flies[269]. The leaves repel fleas and have been used as a strewing herb[20, 201, 257]. They are also used as an insecticide against bed bugs[222]. The ground up husks are also insecticidal[226].

The leaves produce substances that depress the growth of other plants. These substances are washed onto the ground by rain and inhibit the growth of plants beneath the tree[18, 20, 159]. The roots also produce substances that are toxic to many plant species, especially apples (Malus species), members of the Ericaceae, Potentilla spp and the white pines (certain Pinus spp.)[200].

Nowadays it is used mainly as a powerful antispasmodic herb in the treatment of respiratory and muscle disorders[254]. Acting also as a respiratory stimulant, Indian Tobacco is a valuable remedy for conditions such as bronchial asthma and chronic bronchitis[254].

The dried flowering herb and the seed are antiasthmatic, antispasmodic, diaphoretic, diuretic, emetic, expectorant and nervine[4, 7, 21, 46, 165, 171]. The plant is taken internally in the treatment of asthma, bronchitis, whooping cough and pleurisy[238]. This remedy should be used with great caution and only under the supervision of a qualified practitioner[7, 21, 165]. Excess doses cause nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and respiratory failure[238]. See also the notes above on toxicity.

The plant contains the alkaline 'lobeline' which has proved to be of value in helping people to give up smoking tobacco[7, 200, 213]. It is contained in many proprietary anti-smoking mixtures where it mimics the effects of nicotine[238].

The alkaloids present in the leaves are used to stimulate the removal of phlegm from the respiratory tract[213]. When chewed, the leaves induce vomiting, headache and nausea - in larger doses it has caused death[213]. The alkaloids first act as a stimulant and then as a depressive to the autonomic nervous system and in high doses paralyses muscular action in the same way as curare[213].

Externally, the plant is used in treating pleurisy, rheumatism, tennis elbow, whiplash injuries, boils and ulcers[238].

The plant has an oestrogenic action and could prove useful in treating problems related to menstruation and the menopause[254]. Some caution is advised in the use of this plant, however. It should not be prescribed to people with auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis[238]. See also the notes above on toxicity.

The plant is antiscorbutic, aperient, diuretic, oxytocic, haemostatic, nutritive, stimulant and tonic[55, 165, 218]. The expressed juice is emetic and is also anodyne in the treatment of gravel[218]. The plant is taken internally for debility in convalescence or anaemia, haemorrhage, menopausal complaints, pre-menstrual tension, fibroids etc[238]. A poultice of the heated leaves has been applied to the ear in the treatment of earache[257]. The leaves can be used fresh or dried[238].

The leaves are rich in vitamin K which is used medicinally to encourage the clotting of blood[213]. This is valuable in the treatment of jaundice[213]. The plant is grown commercially as a source of chlorophyll and carotene, both of which have proven health benefits[222]. The leaves also contain the anti-oxidant tricin[222].

Eating large quantities of the leaves may cause the breakdown of red blood cells[222]. However, although they are potentially harmful, saponins are poorly absorbed by the human body and so most pass through without harm. Saponins are quite bitter and can be found in many common foods such as some beans. Thorough cooking, and perhaps changing the cooking water once, will normally remove most of them from the food. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K].

Alfalfa sprouts (and especially the seeds) contain canavanine. Recent reports suggest that ingestion of this substance can cause the recurrence of systemic lupus erythematosus (an ulcerous disease of the skin) in patients where the disease had become dormant[222].",,"Alfalfa is a very versatile plant that can adapt to a wide range of climatic conditions from cold temperate to warm sub-tropical.[269]. It succeeds on a wide variety of soils[52, 269], but thrives best on a rich, friable, well-drained loamy soil with loose topsoil supplied with lime[269]. It does not tolerate waterlogging and fails to grow on acid soils[269]. Grows well on light soils[206]. The plant has a deep taproot and, once establishd, tolerates drought and extremely dry conditions[52, 269]. Prefers a neutral fertile soil[87] but succeeds in relatively poor soils so long as the appropriate Rhizobium bacteria is present[200]. A good bee plant[46] and a food plant for many caterpillars[30].

Alfalfa is a very deep rooting plant, bringing up nutrients from deep in the soil and making them available for other plants with shallower root systems. It is a good companion plant for growing near fruit trees and grape vines so long as it is in a reasonably sunny position, but it does not grow well with onions or other members of the Allium genus[201]. Growing alfalfa encourages the growth of dandelions[201].

Alfalfa has long been cultivated for its edible seed, which can be sprouted and eaten in salads. It is also grown as a green manure and soil restorer. There are many named varieties[183].

Botanists divide the species into a number of sub-species - these are briefly described below:-

     M. sativa caerulea (Less. ex Ledeb.)Schmalh. This sub-species is likely to be of value in breeding programmes for giving cold tolerance, drought resistance and salt tolerance to alfalfa.

     M. sativa falcata (L.)Arcang. This sub-species is likely to be of value in breeding programmes for giving cold tolerance, drought and disease resistance plus salt and water-logging tolerance to alfalfa.

     M. sativa sativa. The commonly cultivated form of alfalfa.

     M. sativa varia (Martyn.)Arcang. This sub-species is likely to be of value in breeding programmes for giving cold tolerance, drought resistance and high yields to alfalfa.

This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].","Leaves and young shoots - raw or cooked[2, 8, 52, 145]. The leaves can also be dried for later use[55]. Very rich in vitamins[183], especially A, B and C[201], they are also a good source of protein[206]. The leaves are a rich source of vitamin K[213]. A very nutritious food in moderation, though it can trigger attacks in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and large quantities can affect liver function and cause photosensitization[238]. A nutritional analysis is available[218].

The seed is commonly used as a sprouted seed which is added to salads[2, 20, 52], used in sandwiches etc or cooked in soups[183]. The seed is soaked in warm water for 12 hours, then kept moist in a container in a warm place to sprout. It is ready in about 4 - 6 days[244]. The seeds can also be ground into a powder and used as a mush, or mixed with cereal flours for making a nutritionally improved bread etc[183, 213, 244]. Seed yields average around 186 - 280 kilos per hectare[269].

An appetite-stimulating tea is made from the leaves[21, 55], it has a flavour somewhat reminiscent of boiled socks[144] and is slightly laxative[159].","Often grown as a green manure. It is a bit slow to establish in its first year so is generally only recommended for positions where it can remain for 2 or more years. Alfalfa is very vigorous from its second year, producing a huge bulk of material that can be cut down 2 or 3 times during the season[20, 87]. Plants are very deep rooting, descending 6 metres or more into the soil[200], and are able to fix large quantities of atmospheric nitrogen, this makes them one of the very best green manures. Plants are rather intolerant of competition from grass etc, however, and there is the drawback of needing to leave them in the soil for more than 2 years to fully achieve their potential[K].

Alfalfa is a potenially excellent source of biomass. It is possible to produce more than 2 tonnes of protein from the leaves (suitable for human use) per hectare per year. In addition, the plant residues remaining could be used to produce the equivalent of about 10 barrels of oil per year[269].

A yellow dye is obtained from the seed[269].

The fibre of the plant has been used in making paper[269].

The seed yields about 8.5 - 11% of a drying oil. It is used in paints, varnish etc[46, 57, 61, 269]. 

The plant can be grown as a low dividing hedge in the vegetable garden[52, 206].","Pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water and then sow in spring in situ. The seed can also be sown in situ in autumn[52]. Seed can be obtained that has been inoculated with Rhizobium bacteria, enabling the plant to succeed in soils where the bacteria is not already present.",False,4,,False,3,L.,True,Europe,Mediterranean.

The fruit is about 6mm in diameter with a large seed[200]. There is very little edible flesh and the flavour of this is poor[200, K].","A wax covering on the fruit is extracted by scalding the fruit with boiling water and immersing them for a few minutes, the wax floats to the surface and is then skimmed off. The fruit is then boiled in water to extract the wax from the pulp and once more the wax is skimmed off. It is then strained through a muslin cloth and can be used to make aromatic candles[106, 245]. Candles made from this wax are quite brittle but are less greasy in warm weather[213]. They are slightly aromatic and do not smoke when put out, making them much more pleasant to use that wax or tallow candles[213]. The wax is also used in making soaps[213].

Leaves and berries are used as a food flavouring[62, 105, 177]. They make an aromatic, attractive and agreeable substitute for bay leaves, and can be used in flavouring soups, stews etc[183].

The dried leaves are brewed into a robust tea[183].","A wax covering on the fruit contains palmitic acid and is extracted by scalding the fruit with boiling water and immersing them for a few minutes, the wax floats to the surface and is then skimmed off. The fruit is then boiled in water to extract the wax from the pulp and once more the wax is skimmed off. It is then strained through a muslin cloth and can be used to make aromatic candles, sealing wax etc[1, 4, 6, 11, 62, 95, 171, 245, 274]. Candles made from this wax are quite brittle but are less greasy in warm weather[213]. They are slightly aromatic, with a pleasant balsamic odour[245], and do not smoke when put out, making them much more pleasant to use that wax or tallow candles[213]. The wax is also used in making soaps[213]. About 1 kilo of wax can be obtained from 4 kilos of berries[4].

A blue dye is obtained from the fruit[6].

Pinus strobus,Pinaceae,White Pine,Tree,E,20.0,5.0,,"White pine was employed medicinally by several native North American Indian tribes who valued it especially for its antiseptic and vulnerary qualities, using it extensively in the treatment of skin complaints, wounds, burns, boils etc[257]. It is also very beneficial to the respiratory system and so was used in treating coughs, colds, influenza and so on[257].

The turpentine obtained from the resin of all pine trees is antiseptic, diuretic, rubefacient and vermifuge[4]. It is a valuable remedy used internally in the treatment of kidney and bladder complaints and is used both internally and as a rub and steam bath in the treatment of rheumatic affections[4]. It is also very beneficial to the respiratory system and so is useful in treating diseases of the mucous membranes and respiratory complaints such as coughs, colds, influenza and TB[4]. Externally it is a very beneficial treatment for a variety of skin complaints, wounds, sores, burns, boils etc and is used in the form of liniment plasters, poultices, herbal steam baths and inhalers[4]. A poultice of pitch has been used to draw out toxins from boils and reduce the pain[257].

The dried inner bark is demulcent, diuretic and expectorant[4]. An infusion was used as a treatment for colds[213] and it is still used as an ingredient in commercial cough syrups, where it serves to promote the expulsion of phlegm[213]. A poultice made from the pounded inner bark is used to treat cuts, sores and wounds[213]. The wetted inner bark can be used as a poultice on the chest in treating strong colds[257]. The dried inner bark contains 10% tannin, some mucilage, an oleoresin, a glycoside and a volatile oil[213].

A tea made from the young needles is used to treat sore throats[213]. It is a good source of vitamin C and so is effective against scurvy[213].

An infusion of the young twigs has been used in the treatment of kidney disorders and pulmonary complaints[257].

The powdered wood has been used as a dressing on babies chaffed skin, sores and improperly healed navels[257].","Eastern N.

The white pine is a very important timber crop in its native range, the huge stands that existed before the Europeans went to N. America have been largely cut down[229]. It is a fast-growing and fairly long-lived tree[229] that is often cultivated as a timber tree, especially in central Europe[50]. Young trees grow very vigorously with new shoots of up to 1 metre common. Growth slows and almost ceases by the time the tree is 20 metres tall[185].

Trees can produce cones when 5 - 10 years old, but reliable seed production takes another 10 years[229]. Good crops are produced every 3 - 5 years in the wild, with little seed in the intervening years[229]. The cones are 10 - 20cm long and take 2 years to mature[82, 229], they open and shed their seed in late summer whilst still attached to the tree[82, 226]. Plants often self-sow in Britain[185].

Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200].

Trees have a very thin bark, which makes them particularly susceptible to forest fires[226].

This species is very susceptible to white pine blister rust, it should not be grown near any gooseberries or currants (Ribes species) since these plants can act as vectors for the disease[1, 120]. Plants are also subject to aphid damage[1].

Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].

Leaf secretions inhibit the germination of seeds, thereby reducing the amount of plants that can grow under the trees[18].","Seed - raw or cooked[102, 159]. Rather small and fiddly, it is only about 6mm long[200]. The seed is mainly used as a flavouring in cooking[213].

The fresh needles are brewed into an aromatic tea that is rich in vitamins A and C[183]. A refreshing drink is made from the leaves[159].

An acceptable candy is made by boiling the tender new shoots in syrup[183].

The sticky amber sap can be used for chewing[102, 159].

A vanillin flavouring is obtained as a by-product of other resins that are released from the pulpwood[200].

The firm unexpanded male cones can be boiled and used as a flavouring[177, 183]. A pleasant sweet flavour[257].

Inner bark - raw or cooked. A sweet flavour[105, 159, 161, 213]. There are no more details but inner bark is often dried, ground into a powder and then used as a thickener in soups etc or added to cereals when making bread.","A tan or green dye is obtained from the needles[168].

The needles contain a substance called terpene, this is released when rain washes over the needles and it has a negative effect on the germination of some plants, including wheat[201].

Oleo-resins are present in the tissues of all species of pines, but these are often not present in sufficient quantity to make their extraction economically worthwhile[64]. The resins are obtained by tapping the trunk, or by destructive distillation of the wood[4, 64]. In general, trees from warmer areas of distribution give the higher yields[64]. Turpentine consists of an average of 20% of the oleo-resin[64] and is separated by distillation[4, 64]. Turpentine has a wide range of uses including as a solvent for waxes etc, for making varnish, medicinal etc[4]. Rosin is the substance left after turpentine is removed. This is used by violinists on their bows and also in making sealing wax, varnish etc[4]. Pitch can also be obtained from the resin and is used for waterproofing canoes, containers etc, as a wood preservative etc[257].

Wood - straight and close-grained, light, soft, not strong, works easily and takes an excellent natural or painted finish[46, 61, 82, 171, 226, 229]. It weighs 24lb per cubic foot[235]. A very valuable timber[235], the wood is especially suited for making the masts of ships[4] and is also used for lumber, cheap furniture, house interiors, construction etc[46, 61, 82, 171, 226, 229].","It is best to sow the seed in individual pots in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe if this is possible otherwise in late winter. A short stratification of 6 weeks at 4Â°c can improve the germination of stored seed[80]. Plant seedlings out into their permanent positions as soon as possible and protect them for their first winter or two[11]. Plants have a very sparse root system and the sooner they are planted into their permanent positions the better they will grow[K]. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm[200]. We actually plant them out when they are about 5 - 10cm tall. So long as they are given a very good weed-excluding mulch they establish very well[K]. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years.

Evening primrose oil has become a well-known food supplement since the 1980's. Research suggests that the oil is potentially very valuable in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, pre-menstrual tension, hyperactivity etc[66]. It is also taken internally in the treatment of eczema, acne, brittle nails, rheumatoid arthritis and alcohol-related liver damage[238]. Regular consumption of the oil helps to reduce blood cholesterol levels and lower the blood pressure[21, 66]. The seed is a good source of gamma-linolenic acid, an unsaturated fatty acid which assists the production of hormone-like substances[222, 238]. This process is commonly blocked in the body, causing disorders that affect the uterine muscles, nervous system and metabolism[238].

Olea europaea,Oleaceae,Olive,Tree,E,10.0,8.0,8.0,"The oil from the pericarp is cholagogue, a nourishing demulcent, emollient and laxative[4, 21, 240]. Eating the oil reduces gastric secretions and is therefore of benefit to patients suffering from hyperacidity[238]. The oil is also used internally as a laxative and to treat peptic ulcers[4, 238]. It is used externally to treat pruritis, the effects of stings or burns and as a vehicle for liniments[4, 21]. Used with alcohol it is a good hair tonic and used with oil of rosemary it is a good treatment for dandruff[4, 21]. The oil is also commonly used as a base for liniments and ointments[21].

The leaves are antiseptic, astringent, febrifuge and sedative[4, 21]. A decoction is used in treating obstinate fevers, they also have a  tranquillising effect on nervous tension and hypertension[4, 238]. Experimentally, they have been shown to decrease blood sugar levels by 17 - 23%[240]. Externally, they are applied to abrasions[238].

The bark is astringent, bitter and febrifuge[4, 240]. It is said to be a substitute for quinine in the treatment of malaria[240].

A drought resistant plant once established, it succeeds in dry soils[200]. Requires a sunny position[3]. Tolerates salty air[59]. Plants are slow-growing and very long-lived[188].

The olive is very commonly cultivated in Mediterranean climates for its edible seed, there are many named varieties[132, 183]. Trees can produce a crop when they are 6 years old and continue producing a commercial yield for the next 50 years[200] - many trees continue to give good yields for hundreds of years, even when their trunk is hollow[4]. They succeed outdoors in the milder areas of Britain[11], though plants rarely produce fruit when grown in this country[4, 182, 200], preferring warm temperate regions with mild moist winters and hot dry summers[200]. Some reports say that trees often fruit in south-western England[11, 59]. Generally, older trees are hardy to about -10Â°c[3, 200]. They require the protection of a south facing wall when grown in the London area[11].

At least some cultivars are self-fertile[200]. Some cultivars have been selected mainly for their fruits whilst others have been selected for their oil[200]. 'Mission' is grown for its edible fruits. It is vigorous, prolific and very cold resistant[200]. 'Moraiolo' is grown for its oil, it is very hardy and strong-growing[200].

Flower production depends on a 12 - 15 week period of diurnally fluctuating temperatures with at least 2 months averaging below 10Â°c[200].

Pruning can encourage non-fruiting water-shoots[200]. Weighing down or arching the branches can encourage fruiting[200]. The plants fruit best on wood that is one year old so any pruning should take this into account[238].

An olive branch is a traditional symbol of peace[148], laurel leaves were used by the ancient Greeks to crown winners of the Olympic games[4].

Plants have male flowers and bisexual flowers[200].","Olive fruits are widely used, especially in the Mediterranean, as a relish and flavouring for foods. The fruit is usually pickled or cured with water, brine, oil, salt or lye[2, 3, 4, 89, 183]. They can also be dried in the sun and eaten without curing when they are called 'fachouilles'[183]. The cured fruits are eaten as a relish, stuffed with pimentos or almonds, or used in breads, soups, salads etc[183]. 'Olives schiacciate' are olives picked green, crushed, cured in oil and used as a salad[183]. The fruit contains 20 - 50Âµ vitamin D per 100g[74]. The fruit is up to 4cm long[200].

The seed is rich in an edible non-drying oil, this is used in salads and cooking and, because of its distinct flavour, is considered a condiment[4, 46, 57, 89, 171, 183]. There are various grades of the oil, the finest (known as 'Extra Virgin') is produced by cold pressing the seeds without using heat or chemical solvents[238]. The seed of unpalatable varieties is normally used and this oil has the lowest percentage of acidity and therefore the best flavour[238]. Other grades of the oil come from seeds that are heated (which enables more oil to be expressed but has a deleterious effect on the quality) or from using chemical solvents on seed that has already been pressed for higher grades of oil. Olive oil is mono-unsaturated and regular consumption is thought to reduce the risk of circulatory diseases[238]. The seed contains albumen, it is the only seed known to do this[7].

Leaves[2]. No more details are given.

An edible manna is obtained from the tree[183].","The non-drying oil obtained from the seed is also used for soap making, lighting and as a lubricant[21, 46, 89]. The oil is a good hair tonic and dandruff treatment[21].

Blue and black dyes are obtained from the skins of fresh ripe fruits[168].

A yellow/green dye is obtained from the leaves[168].

Plants are used to stabilize dry dusty hillsides[200].

Wood - very hard, heavy, beautifully grained, takes a fine polish and is slightly fragrant. It is used in turnery and cabinet making, being much valued by woodworkers[4, 7, 46, 100].","Seed - sow late winter in a shady position in a greenhouse[78].

This species was very popular up to the 16th century, but is little used in contemporary European herbalism, though it is sometimes employed where an antispasmodic and sedative are required[238, 254].

The root is antispasmodic, diuretic, sedative and tonic[4, 7, 21]. The root is harvested in the autumn from plants that are at least two years old and is dried for later use[4]. It has been successfully employed in the treatment of convulsions and spasmodic nervous affections such as epilepsy[4, 7]. It has also been used in the treatment of whooping cough whilst suppositories are sometimes made of the root to relieve anal and intestinal spasms[254]. This remedy should be used with caution and not at all by pregnant women. Large doses can be toxic[7, 21, 254].

Sow the seed thinly in fairly deep pots so that the seedlings can be grown on for their first two years without disturbance. Once they have germinated, give them a regular weak liquid feed to ensure that they do not suffer from nutrient deficiency. Once the plants are dormant at the end of their second year of growth, divide them up and put one plant in each pot. Grow them on for at least another year in a shady part of the greenhouse before planting them out into their permanent positions.

Plants can reach 25 metres in height in their native habitat, they are much smaller in Britain but, even so, a height of 12 metres has been recorded in Cornwall.

Cultivated for its edible shoots in China[183], it is the most widely grown bamboo in Japan for its useful canes[195]. It has been widely planted for ornament in the Mediterranean and is becoming naturalized there[50]. There are some named forms selected for their ornamental value[200]. 'Castillon' has smaller culms than the species type, the edible shoots are less bitter[195]. A plant of this cultivar at Trebah gardens in Cornwall was growing well in woodland shade, it was 5 metres tall with canes 20mm in diameter[K].

This is a good companion species to grow in a woodland because the plants are shallow rooted and do not compete with deep rooted trees[195].

The rootstock is running but not aggressively so, especially in the cooler climate of Britain[25]. New shoots are produced from late May[25]. Individual stems can be long lived, staying leafy for up to 20 years[195].

This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200].

Plants only flower at intervals of several years, viable seed is usually produced[122]. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They usually die after flowering, but if left alone they will sometimes recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122].","Young shoots - cooked as a vegetable[25, 46, 105]. Large but somewhat acrid when raw[61], they require boiling in a lot of water or in several changes of water[183]. The shoots are harvested in the spring when they are about 8cm above the ground, cutting them about 5cm below soil level. The shoots contain about 2.1% protein, 0.3% fat, 3.2% carbohydrate, 0.9% ash[179].","The plant has an extensive root system and is used for erosion control.

The stems are used for making furniture, plant supports etc[46, 61, 74]. Fairly thick walled, the canes are considered to be the most versatile of this genus and are used in construction and other industrial uses[195]. Even the dead culms are durable[195].","Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20Â°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Seed is rarely available.

Division in spring as new growth commences. Divisions from the open ground do not transplant well, so will need careful treatment and nurturing under cover in pots until at least late spring[238]. Division is best carried out in wet weather and small divisions will establish better than large clumps[238]. Another report says that you can take large divisions from established clumps and transfer them straight to their permanent positions, misting or drenching them frequently until they are established[200].

The Cape Gooseberry is an evergreen shrub in its native environment. It is not very cold-hardy in Britain, however, though it can succeed outdoors as a herbaceous perennial in the mildest areas of the country or when grown in favoured positions such as the foot of a sunny wall. Some cultivars will tolerate temperatures down to about -10Â° when grown in this way[K]. It would be wise to apply a good protective mulch to the roots in late autumn after the top growth has been cut back by frosts. In most areas of Britain, however, it needs to be grown as an annual in much the same way as tomatoes. The plant is usually naturally bushy, but it can be useful to pinch out the growing tip whilst the shoots are less than 30cm tall in order to encourage side shoots[K].

This species is often cultivated for its edible fruit in warm temperate and tropical zones, there are some named varieties[3, 183]. 'Edulis' is the most common cultivar in Britain, it has considerably larger fruits than the species but these do not have quite such a good flavour[K]. Yields of 20 tonnes per hectare are common in S. America, 33 tonnes has been achieved[196].","Fruit - raw or cooked in pies, cakes, jellies, compotes, jams etc[1, 2, 3, 34, 183]. A delicious bitter-sweet flavour, it has smaller but sweeter fruits than the cultivar 'Edulis'[K]. The dried fruit can be used as a raisin substitute, though it is not so sweet[183]. The plant conveniently wraps up each fruit in its own 'paper bag' (botanically, the calyx) to protect it from pests and the elements. This calyx is toxic and should not be eaten. The fruit is rich in vitamin A (3000 I.U. of carotene per 100g), vitamin C and some of the B complex (thiamine, niacin and B12)[196]. The protein and phosphorus levels are exceptionally high for a fruit[196]. The fruit is a berry about 2cm in diameter[200].

The dried fruit is said to be a substitute for yeast[183]. If picked carefully with the calyx intact, the fruit can be stored for 3 months or more[196]. The fruit is about 2cm in diameter[196].",None known,"Seed - sow March/April in a greenhouse only just covering the seed. Germination usually takes place quickly and freely. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots of fairly rich soil when they are large enough to handle and plant them out after the last expected frosts. Consider giving them some protection such as a cloche until they are growing away well. Diurnal temperature fluctuations assist germination[170].

Division in spring[111]. This is best done without digging up the plant. Remove young shoots that are growing out from the side of the clump, making sure that some of the below ground shoot is also removed.

A fast growing tree, especially when young with annual increases of up to 1 metre in height[185]. New growth takes place from April to July. Growth slows considerably as the trees grow older[185]. It is an important forestry tree in N. America and is also planted for timber in N. Europe. It is sometimes used as a 'Christmas tree', but is unsuited for this because its leaves quickly fall[226].

Seed production begins at approximately 20 years, though reliable crops make take twice that long[229]. Heavy crops are produced every 2 - 5 years[229].

Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200].

In some upland areas, especially over granitic or other base-poor soils, growth rate and health have been seriously affected by aluminium poisoning induced by acid rain[200].

Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200].

Plants often colonise exposed mountain slopes in the wild, their root system anchoring them firmly[226].

A long-lived but slow-growing tree in the wild[229]. It grows well in Britain[81], coning regularly at Kew[11], but not doing so well in the milder parts of the country[120]. It is best suited for growing in northern areas at higher elevations[120]. Trees do not produce large numbers of cones but small numbers are formed annually[229].

The cones are up to 8cm long, they ripen in late summer and do not open on the tree but fall intact to the ground[81, 82, 200, 226]. This species is the only N. American pine with this habit and it is thus considered to be a primitive species[226]. The seed is extracted by breaking up the soft scales of the cone[200]. Birds and mammals often open the cones and eat the seeds before they mature[1].

Leaf secretions inhibit the germination of seeds, thereby inhibiting the growth of other plants below the tree[18].

Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200].

This species is closely related to P. flexilis[11], differing mainly in the cones[226].

The needles contain a substance called terpene, this is released when rain washes over the needles and it has a negative effect on the germination of some plants, including wheat[201].

Oleo-resins are present in the tissues of all species of pines, but these are often not present in sufficient quantity to make their extraction economically worthwhile[64]. The resins are obtained by tapping the trunk, or by destructive distillation of the wood[4, 64]. In general, trees from warmer areas of distribution give the higher yields[64]. Turpentine consists of an average of 20% of the oleo-resin[64] and is separated by distillation[4, 64]. Turpentine has a wide range of uses including as a solvent for waxes etc, for making varnish, medicinal etc[4]. Rosin is the substance left after turpentine is removed. This is used by violinists on their bows and also in making sealing wax, varnish etc[4]. Pitch can also be obtained from the resin and is used for waterproofing, as a wood preservative etc.

Plants have a very sparse root system and the sooner they are planted into their permanent positions the better they will grow[K]. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm[200]. We actually plant them out when they are about 5 - 10cm tall. So long as they are given a very good weed-excluding mulch they establish very well[K]. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200].

Dislikes poorly drained moorland soils and shady positions[1]. Starts away well on almost any soil, whether poorly drained or shallow and dry[185]. Established plants tolerate drought[200]. 

A fast growing tree when young[200], but growth soon slows down and the tree is short-lived in Britain with no tree known to be older than 75 years[185]. New shoots can be almost 1 metre long, though the tree remains spindly[185]. An open-topped tree, though plants sometimes have a shrubby habit of growth[82]. They can start producing seed when only a few years old[82].

The cones are 4- 5cm long[82]. They ripen in their second year but can remain un-opened on the tree for a number of years, only opening and shedding their seed after a forest fire has heated them to at least 50Â°c[226]. This makes them one of the first colonizers of burnt land[226].

Cultivated for timber in C. Europe[50].

Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. This species hybridises in the wild with P. contorta where their ranges overlap[226].

There are several named varieties selected for their ornamental value[200].

A vanillin flavouring is obtained as a by-product of other resins that are released from the pulpwood[200].","A tan or green dye is obtained from the needles[168].

Various native North American Indian tribes made a string from the long roots of this species and used it to stitch the bark of their canoes[226, 257]. In a sandy soil, the roots of this species extend near the surface of the soil for perhaps 10 metres and are easy to pull out of the ground for their entire length. When gathered, they were made into coils and sunk beneath the surface of water until the outer bark had loosened from the root. They were then peeled and split in half, each half being a serviceable cord for sewing together canoes and bark strips intended for the roofs of wigwams and other purposes[257].

The needles contain a substance called terpene, this is released when rain washes over the needles and it has a negative effect on the germination of some plants, including wheat[201].

Oleo-resins are present in the tissues of all species of pines, but these are often not present in sufficient quantity to make their extraction economically worthwhile[64]. The resins are obtained by tapping the trunk, or by destructive distillation of the wood[4, 64]. In general, trees from warmer areas of distribution give the higher yields[64]. Turpentine consists of an average of 20% of the oleo-resin[64] and is separated by distillation[4, 64]. Turpentine has a wide range of uses including as a solvent for waxes etc, for making varnish, medicinal etc[4]. Rosin is the substance left after turpentine is removed. This is used by violinists on their bows and also in making sealing wax, varnish etc[4]. Pitch can also be obtained from the resin and is used for waterproofing, as a wood preservative etc[257].

Wood - fairly light, soft, coarse, weak[46, 61, 82, 226]. It weighs 27lb per cubic foot[235].

Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].","Inner bark - raw or cooked[2, 94, 105, 161, 257]. It can be used fresh or dried. It is mashed into a pulp and made into cakes then baked[94]. Harvested in early spring, the taste is not unpleasant, but it develops a strong taste of turpentine as the season advances[2]. The inner bark is ready to harvest when the male cones are producing pollen[257]. A famine food, it is only used when all else fails.

Sap - collected in spring and used as a drink[161, 177].

Seed - raw or cooked[257].

A gum is made from the pitch obtained from the trunk. It is allowed to harden and used for chewing[257].

A vanillin flavouring is obtained as a by-product of other resins that are released from the pulpwood[200].","A tan or green dye is obtained from the needles[168].

The roots have been braided by the N. American Indians to make a rope[226].

The needles contain a substance called terpene, this is released when rain washes over the needles and it has a negative effect on the germination of some plants, including wheat[201].

A pitch obtained from this tree is used for waterproofing canoes, baskets, shoes etc and as a glue[64, 99, 226, 257]. It has also been used to preserve wood, baskets etc[257]. The pitch is not a commercially important crop[64].

Oleo-resins are present in the tissues of all species of pines, but these are often not present in sufficient quantity to make their extraction economically worthwhile[64]. The resins are obtained by tapping the trunk, or by destructive distillation of the wood[4, 64]. In general, trees from warmer areas of distribution give the higher yields[64]. Turpentine consists of an average of 20% of the oleo-resin[64] and is separated by distillation[4, 64]. Turpentine has a wide range of uses including as a solvent for waxes etc, for making varnish, medicinal etc[4]. Rosin is the substance left after turpentine is removed. This is used by violinists on their bows and also in making sealing wax, varnish etc[4]. Pitch can also be obtained from the resin and is used for waterproofing, as a wood preservative etc.

Wood - straight but coarse-grained, light, hard, strong, brittle[60, 82]. It varies from light and soft to hard and heavy[229]. Easily worked, it is used for general construction, posts, poles, pulp etc[60, 82, 99, 171, 226, 229]. It makes a good fuel, burning well even when green because it is rich in pitch[99, 226].","It is best to sow the seed in individual pots in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe if this is possible otherwise in late winter. A short stratification of 6 weeks at 4Â°c can improve the germination of stored seed[80]. Plant seedlings out into their permanent positions as soon as possible and protect them for their first winter or two[11]. Plants have a very sparse root system and the sooner they are planted into their permanent positions the better they will grow[K]. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm[200]. We actually plant them out when they are about 5 - 10cm tall. So long as they are given a very good weed-excluding mulch they establish very well[K]. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200].

Cuttings. This method only works when taken from very young trees less than 10 years old. Use single leaf fascicles with the base of the short shoot.

A short-lived tree in Britain. It is slow to get established but it then grows strongly[120]. Of moderate growth in height with increases of about 30 - 40cm a year, but of rapid increase in girth, about 3 - 5cm a year[185]. Trees grow better in the southern part of the country[120].

Trees do not often bear cones in Britain[11, 81]. A tree planted in 1954 at Kew was about 12 metres tall in September 1993 and was carrying a number of large cones[K]. The summer had been cool and damp[K]. The same tree had another good crop of cones in the autumn of 1996 and continues to cone quite well in 1999[K]. An 11 year old tree at Kew had two small female cones in January 1999[K].

The fresh cones can weigh 2.2 kilos and when dried in a warm room for a year or so still weigh Â½ kilo. The cones open and shed their seed whist still attached to the tree[226]. The seeds are ejected explosively from the dry cone over a period of several weeks[185]. The cones are 25 - 35cm long[82], they can hang on the tree for a number of years with their seed intact[81].

This species is closely related to P. sabiniana[229].

Leaf secretions inhibit the germination of seeds, thereby inhibiting the growth of other plants below the tree[18].

The gum (this almost certainly means the resin[K]) is used in waterproofing baskets, canoes etc, for repairing pottery vessels and in making turquoise mosaic[216, 257]. It has also been used as a red paint on jars and bowls[257]. For waterproofing containers, the gum was melted and poured inside the container. The container was then turned round to ensure the gum came into contact with all parts of the inside. More gum would then be applied to the outside[257].

The resin has been used as a glue for fixing turquoise in jewellery[257].

The gum has been used, with sumac leaves (Rhus spp) and yellow ochre to make a black dye and ink[257]. The sumac leaves are boiled until there is a strong mixture. Whilst the sumac was boiling, the ochre was powdered and roasted. The gum was then added to the ochre and the whole roasted again. As the roasting proceeded, the gum melted and finally the mixture was reduced to a black powder. This was then cooled and thrown into the sumac mixture, forming a rich blue-black fluid that was essentially an ink[257].

This species grows in an area where the summers are long and hot and the winters are mild[229]. It is not very hardy in Britain[1], especially when young, and grows much smaller in this country than it does in the wild[200]. It dislikes temperatures falling below about -5Â°c[238]. There are, however, some trees that were 15 metres tall in south-eastern England in 1970[185]. Trees in the wild grow slowly, taking about 150 years to reach maximum size and living  200 - 300 years[229].

Young seedlings are very slow growing for their first few years and look more like a clump of grass than a tree. They do not begin to grow a stem for their first few years. It is believed that this is a form of protection from forest fires since the heat might pass over the small tree without killing it and leaving it without much competition[K].

Leaf secretions inhibit the germination of seeds, thereby reducing the amount of plants that can grow under the trees[18].

The cones are 15 - 25cm long, they open and shed their seed whilst still attached to the tree[82, 226].

Carpets are woven from the leaves[4].

This species is exceedingly rich in resinous secretions and is a major source of resin and turpentine in America[64, 82, 200], but it is too tender in Britain for it to be used here. Oleo-resins are present in the tissues of all species of pines, but these are often not present in sufficient quantity to make their extraction economically worthwhile[64]. The resins are obtained by tapping the trunk, or by destructive distillation of the wood[4, 64]. In general, trees from warmer areas of distribution give the higher yields[64]. Turpentine consists of an average of 20% of the oleo-resin[64] and is separated by distillation[4, 64]. Turpentine has a wide range of uses including as a solvent for waxes etc, for making varnish, perfumery, medicinal etc[4, 238]. Rosin is the substance left after turpentine is removed. This is used by violinists on their bows and also in making sealing wax, varnish etc[4]. Pitch can also be obtained from the resin and is used for waterproofing, as a wood preservative etc.

Wood - heavy,  very hard, tough, strong, coarse grained, durable[61, 82, 171]. It weighs 44lb per cubic foot[235].

Populus trichocarpa,Salicaceae,Western Balsam Poplar,Tree,D,40.0,12.0,5.0,"Western balsam poplar has a long history of herbal use. It was commonly used by many native North American Indian tribes who valued it especially for its antiseptic and expectorant properties, using it to treat lung complaints, wounds, skin conditions etc[257]. It is still commonly employed in modern herbalism with much the same uses.

The leaf buds are covered with a resinous sap that has a strong turpentine odour and a bitter taste[213]. They also contain salicin, a glycoside that probably decomposes into salicylic acid (aspirin) in the body[213]. The buds are antiscorbutic, antiseptic, balsamic, diuretic, expectorant, stimulant and tonic[4, 226, 238]. They are taken internally in the treatment of bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infections. They should not be prescribed to patients who are sensitive to aspirin[238]. Externally, the buds are used to treat colds, sinusitis, arthritis, rheumatism, muscular pain and dry skin conditions[238]. They can be put in hot water and used as an inhalant to relieve congested nasal passages[213]. The buds are harvested in the spring before they open and are dried for later use[238].

It dislikes shade and is intolerant of root or branch competition[11, 200]. Plants are reasonably wind resistant, but they do not grow well in exposed upland sites[11].

Many forms of this species are susceptible to bacterial canker, the female clone 'Fritzi Pauley' is resistant[11, 200].

A very fast growing[11] and ornamental tree[1], it does well in western Britain where trees have reached 25 metres tall in 20 years[11].

Antipyretic, antiseptic, emetic, ophthalmic[194].

The flowers are tonic, promoting fecundity in women[218].

The bark is astringent[254]. The inner bark and/or the root are used for treating poisoning caused by eating bitter almond and apricot seeds (which contain hydrogen cyanide)[218]. Another report says that a decoction of the outer bark is used to neutralize the effects of hydrogen cyanide[238]. The decoction is also used to soothe inflamed and irritated skin conditions[254].

The seed is analgesic, anthelmintic, antiasthmatic, antispasmodic, antitussive, demulcent, emollient, expectorant, pectoral, sedative and vulnerary[176, 218]. It is used in the treatment of asthma, coughs, acute or chronic bronchitis and constipation[176, 279].

The seed contains 'laetrile', a substance that has also been called vitamin B17[218]. This has been claimed to have a positive effect in the treatment of cancer, but there does not at present seem to be much evidence to support this[K].

Succeeds in light shade but fruits better in a sunny position[200]. Thrives in a loamy soil, doing well on limestone[11]. Prefers some chalk in the soil but is apt to become chlorotic if too much is present[11]. Prefers a pH in the range 6.5 to 7.5[200]. Dislikes clay soils[37, 61]. Intolerant of saline soils[200]. Trees drop their fruit buds if there is a summer drought[200].

The apricot is widely cultivated for its edible fruit in temperate areas that have long hot summers, there are many named varieties[183, 200]. The tree is perfectly hardy in Britain but it usually flowers very early in the spring and the flowers are then liable to be destroyed by frosts[11]. It really requires a more continental climate (with its clearly defined seasons) than it gets in Britain. However, if given the benefit of a south or west facing wall and some protection from frosts when it is in flower, reasonable crops can usually be produced in southern England[1, 219]. The plants are self-fertile[200], but hand pollination would be advisable since they are normally flowering before many pollinating insects are active.

In Britain apricots are usually grown on plum rootstocks, 'St. Julien A' is the most widely used[200]. The dwarfing rootstock 'Pixie' is also a possibility, but this must be double worked with 'St. Julien A' because it is incompatible with apricots[200].

Any pruning should be carried out in the summer to allow rapid healing and therefore less risk of infection[201].

Oats should not be grown near apricots because their roots have an antagonistic effect on the roots of the apricot[201]. Tomatoes and potatoes are also bad companions for apricots[201]. If nasturtiums (Tropaeoleum spp) are grown under apricots they will make the fruit less palatable to insects, though this is not detectable by the human palate[201].

The almond is often cultivated in the temperate zone for its edible seeds, there are many named varieties[63, 200]. It prefers a Mediterranean climate with a clear distinction between winter and spring, in milder maritime areas it can be induced into flower too early in the season and is then very liable to be damaged by frosts[200]. There is also likely to be a shortage of pollinating insects around when the tree is in flower so hand pollination may improve the crop. Although partially self-fertile, better crops are obtained if at least 2 cultivars are grown[200].

There are two basic forms of almonds, one with bitter seeds and one with 'sweet' seeds. The bitterness is caused by the presence of hydrogen cyanide (see notes above). Although the bitter forms are used in making marzipan and as a food flavouring, the seeds themselves should not be eaten. Even the sweet forms should not be eaten in very large quantities. (Approximately 900 seeds at one time is considered to be a toxic dose for the average adult).

Trees are normally hardy in southern Britain[11], tolerating temperatures down to about -20Â°c when they are dormant[184], but they require some protection if cropping is to be at all reliable[11]. This is not due so much to lack of cold hardiness, more to the cooler summers in Britain which do not fully ripen the wood and the fruit, plus the unpredictable winters and springs which, in a mild spell, can excite the tree into premature flowering and growth which is then very liable to damage in any following cold spell. Hand pollination at this time can improve fruit-set[200]. The cultivar 'Rochester' is more likely than most cultivars to succeed outdoors in Britain[200]. In general it is best to site peaches in a very warm sheltered sunny position, preferably against a south or west facing wall[200, 219].

Most cultivars are self-fertile[200].

Trees are often grafted onto plum or other rootstocks but are said to be better when grown on their own roots in southern Britain[11].

Trees are not generally long-lived[200], this is partly because of the need for the tree to produce a constant supply of new wood since most fruit is formed on one-year old wood (though some fruit spurs are formed)[200].

Garlic is a good companion for this plant, helping to prevent disease, especially peach leaf curl[20, 201]. Tansy grown below peach trees helps to keep them healthier[201]. Peach leaf curl can also be prevented by protecting the plants from winter and early spring rains, perhaps by covering them in plastic[200].

The bark of the root, trunk and branches is antitussive, astringent, pectoral, sedative, stomachic, tonic[4, 21, 95, 165, 238]. The medicinal properties of this plant are destroyed by boiling, so the plant should only be allowed to steep in warm water[213].

The root bark and the aromatic inner bark have expectorant and mild sedative properties and a tea made from either of them has been used to ease pain in the early stages of labour[213, 222]. The tea is also used in the treatment of fevers, colds, sore throats, diarrhoea etc[222, 257]. The bark is harvested in the autumn and should not be stored for longer than one year since it quickly loses its medicinal properties[4, 213]. Young thin bark is preferred[213].

A decoction of the inner bark has been used in the treatment of laryngitis[257].

The root bark has been used as a wash on old sores and ulcers[257].

The bark contains the glycoside prunasin, which is converted in the digestive tract to the highly toxic hydrocyanic acid[222]. Prunasin is at its highest level in the bark in the autumn[222] so the bark is harvested at this time and can be dried for later use[254].

This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200].

Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122].

A very ornamental plant[1], it is said to be the hardiest bamboo[25], tolerating temperatures down to about -15Â°c[200]. Down to -24Â°c according to another report. In warmer parts of Britain plants can attain a height of 6 metres or more.

The rootstock is running and very invasive[25]. It is fairly easy to control, however, if any new shoots that are not wanted are broken off whilst they are still small and brittle. New shoots appear from April[25].

This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200].

Plants often flower lightly for a number of years without dying out though they seldom produce viable seed[122]. Occasionally the plants can produce an abundance of flowers and this severely weakens, though does not usually kill, the plants. They can take some years to recover. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122].

Canes are fairly thin walled but make very good plant supports[25, 75, 195]. Smaller canes can be plaited together and used as screens or as lathes for walls and ceilings[195].

Tolerant of maritime exposure, it can be grown as a screen or windbreak hedge in very exposed positions[75, 166]. The culms make an excellent wind filter, slowing its speed without creating turbulence.

Pueraria montana lobata,Leguminosae,Kudzu Vine,Perennial Climber,,10.0,,6.0,"The kudzu vine, known as Ge Gen in China, is commonly used in Chinese herbalism, where it is considered to be one of the 50 fundamental herbs[218]. Recent research has shown that compounds called 'daidzin' and 'daidzein', which are contained in the roots and the flowers, are a safe and effective method for treating alcohol abuse[238]. They work by suppressing the appetite for alcohol, whereas existing treatments interfere with the way the alcohol is metabolised and can cause a build-up of toxins[238]. The plant is often used in combination with Chrysanthemum x morifolium in treating alcohol abuse[254].

The flowers and the roots are antidote, antiemetic, antipyretic, antispasmodic, demulcent, diaphoretic, digestive, febrifuge, hypoglycaemic and hypotensive[174, 176, 218, 222, 238]. A concoction of the flowers and tubers is used to treat alcoholism, fever, colds, diarrhoea, dysentery, acute intestinal obstruction etc[174, 176, 218, 222]. It is useful in the treatment of angina pectoris and migraine[218]. The root is frequently used as a remedy for measles, often in combination with Cimicifuga foetida[254].

The root contains puerarin. This increases the blood flow to the coronary artery and protects against acute myocardial ischaemia caused by the injection of pituitrin[176].

The root can be harvested from the autumn to the spring and is used fresh or dried[238].

The flowers are harvested just before they are fully open and are dried for later use[238].

The stems are galactogogue and are also applied as a poultice to incipient boils, swellings, sore mouths etc[218, 222].

The seed is used in the treatment of hangover and dysentery[218, 222].

Succeeds in most well-drained soils in a sunny position[200], though it does not make good growth on very light poor sand or on poorly drained heavy clay[269]. Plants cannot stand waterlogging on any soil[269]. A deep-rooted pant, once established it is very drought resistant[171, 269]. The plant is reported to tolerate an annual precipitation in the range of 97 to 214cm, an annual mean temperature in the range of 12.2 to 26.7Â°C, and a pH of 5.0 to 7.1[269].

Plants are hardy to about -15Â°c, they can resprout from the base if they are cut down by frosts[200]. A twining plant, the top growth is not generally hardy in Britain and plants do not always flower here[1]. Plants can be grown as annuals in Britain, the seed is started off in a greenhouse and is planted out after the last frosts[1]. They can grow up to 6 metres in their first year and make good temporary screens[1]. The plant succeeds outdoors in Berlin, but it has to be propagated vegetatively there[74].

This plant is cultivated for its edible root in Japan and China[183].

The flowers have a sweet vanilla scent[245].

When grown in warmer climates than Britain the root can be invasive and plants have become weeds[182, 219]. Introduced into the southern N. American states in 1876 as a soil stabilizer, the plant has spread very widely (it can grow up to 30cm in a day), has swamped out native vegetation, including large trees. It is considered to be one of the most obnoxious weeds in that region[274].

This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].","Root - cooked[105, 171]. Rich in starch[109]. The root can be up to 1.8 metres long[174] and has been known to weigh 35 kilos or more[269]. The root contains about 10% starch, this can be extracted and used as a crispy coating in deep fried foods, or for thickening soups etc[174, 183]. It can also be made into noodles, or like agar or gelatine is used as a gelling agent for salads[183]. This plant is a staple food in Japan, the peeled root contains about 2.1% protein, 0.1% fat, 27.1% carbohydrate, 1.4% ash[179]. The starch of the roots contains (per 100 g) 340 calories, 16.5 percent moisture, 0.2 g protein, 0.1 g fat, 83.1 g total carbohydrate, 0.1 g ash, 35 mg Ca, 18 mg P, 2.0 mg Fe, and 2 mg Na[269]. A nutritional analysis for the whole root is available.

Flowers - cooked or made into pickles[183].

Stems and young leaves - raw or cooked[105]. A very nutritious food, the fresh young shoots taste like a cross between a bean and a pea[183].

The fibre is 2 - 3mm long and can be used to make paper. Straight first year stems, 2 - 2.7 metres long, are harvested in mid summer, the leaves are removed and the stems steamed until the fibres can be stripped. The fibres are then cooked for 2 hours with lye, tough vines might require 4 hours cooking, and the fibre put in a ball mill for 3 hours. The resulting paper is greenish/cream in colour[189].

Can be used as a ground cover plant in a sunny position[188].

Plants have an extensive root system which can be 1.8 metres deep, they are used for erosion control and for rebuilding depleted soils[171, 174].

Either the whole seed can be used or the seed can be dried and ground it into a powder. It can take several days or even weeks to properly leach whole seeds, one method was to wrap them in a cloth bag and place them in a stream. Leaching the powder is quicker. A simple taste test can tell when the tannin has been leached. The traditional method of preparing the seed was to bury it in boggy ground overwinter. The germinating seed was dug up in the spring when it would have lost most of its astringency.

The roasted seed is a coffee substitute.","A mulch of the leaves repels slugs, grubs etc, though fresh leaves should not be used as these can inhibit plant growth[20].

Oak galls are excrescences that are sometimes produced in great numbers on the tree and are caused by the activity of the larvae of different insects. The insects live inside these galls, obtaining their nutrient therein. When the insect pupates and leaves, the gall can be used as a rich source of tannin, that can also be used as a dyestuff[4].

The acorn meal has been used to mend cracks in clay pots[257].

The root is the main part used and it can be prepared in four different ways - charcoaled, prepared (but no details of the preparation are given) when it is called Shu Di Huang and fresh or dried when it is called Sheng Di Huang[176].

The roots are antibacterial, antiseptic, cardiac, diuretic, febrifuge, haemostatic, hypoglycaemic and tonic[61, 176, 178, 218, 238, 279]. They are used in the treatment of a wide range of ailments, including anaemia, cancer, bleeding, constipation, coughs, fever and premature ejaculation[174, 176, 218, 238]. The charcoaled root is used to stop bleeding and tonify the spleen and stomach[176]. The fresh root is used to treat thirst, the rash of infectious diseases and bleeding due to pathological heat[176]. The dried root is used to treat bleeding due to blood deficiency and to nourish the vital essence[176]. The prepared root is used to treat dizziness and palpitations due to anaemia or blood deficiency, chronic tidal fever, night sweats, dry mouth, lumbago and nocturnal emissions[176]. The roots of cultivated plants are harvested in the autumn or early winter, whilst wild plants are harvested in early spring[238]. They can be used fresh or dried[238].

The root is an ingredient of 'Four Things Soup', the most widely used woman's tonic in China[254]. The other species used are Angelica sinensis, Ligusticum wallichii and Paeonia lactiflora[254].

The other herbs included in the formula are Arctium lappa, Ulmus rubra and Rumex acetosella[254].

The root is anticholesterolemic, antiseptic, antispasmodic, antitumor, aperient, astringent, cholagogue, demulcent, diuretic, laxative, purgative, stomachic and tonic[4, 7, 9, 21, 91, 171, 176, 238]. The roots contain anthraquinones, which have a purgative effect, and also tannins and bitters, which have an opposite astringent effect[244]. When taken in small doses, it acts as an astringent tonic to the digestive system, whilst larger doses act as a mild laxative[232, 244]. The root is taken internally in the treatment of chronic constipation, diarrhoea, liver and gall bladder complaints, haemorrhoids, menstrual problems and skin eruptions due to an accumulation of toxins[238]. This remedy is not prescribed for pregnant or lactating women, nor for patients with intestinal obstruction[238]. Externally, the root is used in the treatment of burns[238].

Rhubarb is a long-lived and almost indestructible perennial plant[264]. It is often cultivated for its edible leaf stems, there are many named varieties[74, 183]. Most cultivars produce edible stems from spring to early summer, though 'Glaskin's Perpetual' can be harvested throughout the summer.

By digging up the roots in the autumn and exposing them to frost, earlier growth will be initiated. These roots can then be transferred to a cold frame or other protected area where they will produce their edible stems in late winter. It is also possible to produce earlier crops outdoors by covering the plants with a layer of straw and an upturned bucket.

A tea made from the inner bark and root bark is diuretic, emetic and a strong laxative[222, 257]. A tea made from the root bark is used to promote labour in childbirth and in treating headaches, kidney problems and mucous congestion[21, 257]. The inner bark is also applied as a poultice to cuts, sore or swollen limbs etc in order to relieve pain and swelling[222, 257].

A poultice of the leaves is applied to bruises and to cuts in order to stop the bleeding[222].

An infusion of the leaf buds is strongly purgative[21].

Elder flowers are stimulant, diaphoretic and diuretic[213, 257]. A warm tea of the flowers is stimulant and induces sweating, taken cold it is diuretic[21].

For best production, it requires high nutrient soils with a high level of nitrogen, but it may be grown on a wide range of soils from light to heavy, growing best on relatively heavy sandy loamy soils[269]. It is not suited to very wet soils[269]. White mustard grows best where the annual precipitation varies from 35 to 179cm, annual temperature from 5.6 to 24.9Â°C and pH from 4.5 to 8.2[269].

White mustard is a quick-growing long-day annual which prefers temperate climates with some humidity. It is sometimes cultivated, both in the garden and commercially, for its edible seed[4, 183]. The plant can withstand high temperatures, but very hot days during flowering and ripening may reduce seed setting and lower quality of seed[269]. There are some named varieties[183]. It is a very fast growing plant, but requires plenty of moisture for optimum growth[87].

Seed yields are usually a bit less than 1 tonne per hectare, though experimental plantings have suggested that up to 8 tonnes per hectare is possible[269].

White mustard is sometimes also grown as a seed sprout, usually with cress seeds (Lepidium sativum) to supply mustard and cress. This is a mixture of the two types of sprouted seeds, used when about 7 - 10 days old[K]. The mustard seed should be sown three days before the cress seed[238].

The seed can be ground into a powder and used as a food flavouring[17, 34, 89, 171], it is the 'white mustard' of commerce[100, 105]. This is milder than the black mustard obtained from Brassica nigra[183]. The pungency of mustard develops when cold water is added to the ground-up seed - an enzyme (myrosin) acts on a glycoside (sinigrin) to produce a sulphur compound. The reaction takes 10 - 15 minutes. Mixing with hot water or vinegar, or adding salt, inhibits the enzyme and produces a mild bitter mustard[238].","The seed contains up to 35% of a semi-drying oil[74]. It is used as a lubricant and for lighting etc[21, 46, 57, 61]. 

The plant can be grown as a green manure crop[17, 89]. It is very fast growing, producing a good bulk in just a few weeks from seed, but it is shallow rooted so does not do so well in dry periods[87]. It is also susceptible to all the diseases of the cabbage family such as club-root so is best avoided if this is likely to be a problem[17].","Seed - sow in situ from early spring to late summer. Germination takes place in less than a week. The earlier sowings are for a seed crop, the later sowings are for edible leaves and green manure[82].

When sowing seed for use in mustard and cress, the seed is soaked for about 12 hours in warm water and then placed in a humid position. Traditionally, it is sown in a tray on a thin layer of soil, or on some moist blotting paper, and the tray is placed in a warm dark place for a few days to encourage rapid and rather etiolated growth. The seedlings can then be placed in a lighter position for a couple more days to turn green before being eaten.

The plant has an established antiviral activity and is most commonly used in modern herbalism to treat warts and polyps, being prescribed both internally and externally for these conditions[254]. The plant can be used to induce menstruation and so should not be prescribed for pregnant women[238].

The recently dried leafy young twigs are alterative, anthelmintic, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, aromatic, astringent, diaphoretic, diuretic and emmenagogue[4, 7, 21, 165]. The plant is being used internally in the treatment of cancer[238], especially cancer of the uterus[254]. A tea made from the leaves is used in the treatment for bronchitis and other respiratory problems, colds, headaches and as a cough syrup[222, 254]. The plants diuretic properties make it useful in treating acute cystitis and bed-wetting in children[254]. The leaves are used in steam baths in the treatment of rheumatism, arthritis, colds etc[222]. Externally, the leaves are used as a wash for swollen feet and burns[222]. Extracts of the leaves can be painted on painful joints or muscles as a counter0irritant, improving local blood supply and thus facilitating the removal of toxins, easing pain and stiffness[254]. A tincture of the leaves has been used in the treatment of warts, piles, bed sores and fungal infections[222]. The leaves and young twigs can be harvested as required and used fresh or dried[238].

'Oil of white cedar', obtained from the leaves, is an essential oil that is antiseptic, expectorant and rubefacient[213, 222]. It is used internally to promote menstruation and relieve rheumatism[213].

Prefers some shelter from the wind according to some reports[1, 81] whilst others say that it is fairly wind resistant[11, 75]. Trees tolerate salt winds[75] but not severe maritime exposure[K].

The wood and foliage are highly aromatic[226]. The foliage has a strong fruity smell, like pear-drops or crushed apples[185].

A fast growing tree, it often puts out new growth of 1 metre a year and can average 60cm a year for the first 40 years. Increase in girth can also be rapid, 5cm a year for the first 60 years has been recorded[185]. Sometimes planted for forestry in Britain[17], it is at its best in the moister western half of the country[11, 185].

There are many named varieties selected for their ornamental value[188].

Tolerant of light trimming, so long as this is not back into old wood, plants also retain their lower branches unless these are shaded out by neighbouring plants[11].

The roots are used in basket making, making nets etc[99]. The roots have been used in coiled and imbricated baskets[257]. The roots have been peeled, split and used to make coiled watertight baskets that can be used for boiling water[257]. The roots are harvested in the spring or early autumn when it is easier to remove the bark. The outer strips of the roots are used to make the bottom of the basket, the centre core is used in the coils and the root bark, because of its toughness, is used to make the edges[257].

The fibrous bark is used for roofing and the sides of shelters. It is also used as an insulation[61, 99].

A fibre obtained from the bark is used in making paper. The fibre is about 3.8mm long (this refers to the heartwood fibre, the inner bark fibre is probably longer)[189]. Branches can be harvested at any time of the year, they are cut into usable pieces and pre-soaked in clear water prior to cooking. They are then cooked for six hours or more with lye. It is difficult to rinse it to clear water because it seems to be a dye material[189]. The fibre is then hand pounded with mallets, or put through a blender or a ball mill for six hours. It is difficult to hydrate properly. The resulting paper is a rich deep brown/red[189].

The slender pliable branches are used as a high quality rope[257]. They are gathered in spring, peeled and, if thick, are split into halves or quarters. They are then twisted and worked until soft and pliable and finally woven together to make the rope[99].

A green dye can be obtained from the leaves and twigs[257].

The inner bark can be used as a tinder[257].

Wood - aromatic, light, soft, straight-grained, not strong, very resistant to decay. This resistance to decay is probably due to the existence of powerful fungicides in the wood[226]. The wood from fallen trees remains sound for at least 100 years[226]. It is pale to dark red in colour[226]. The wood was widely utilized by many native North American Indian tribes who used it for making a wide range of items including canoes, houses, totem poles, bowls, spoons, ladles and tools[226, 257]. It is currently used in making greenhouses[1, 11, 82, 171]. The wood is not of such good quality when grown in mild humid areas[1].

A moderately fast growing and long-lived species in the wild[229]. It prefers a  continental climate, growing more slowly and not producing fertile seed in areas with cool summers[200]. It is fairly susceptible to forest fires because it has a thin bark[229].

Lime trees tend to hybridise freely if other members of the genus are growing nearby[238]. If growing plants from seed it is important to ensure the seed came from a wild source or from an isolated clump of the single species[K].

Grows best in a woodland situation, young plants tolerate a reasonable level of side shade[200].

It has a wide range of medicinal applications[254]. The seeds are very nourishing and are given to convalescents and to encourage weight gain, especially in anorexia nervosa[254]. The seeds should not be prescribed medicinally for pregnant women since they can induce uterine contractions[238, 254]. Research has shown that the seeds can inhibit cancer of the liver, lower blood cholesterol levels and also have an antidiabetic effect[254].

The seed and leaves are anticholesterolemic, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, carminative, demulcent, deobstruent, emollient, expectorant, febrifuge, galactogogue, hypoglycaemic, laxative, parasiticide, restorative and uterine tonic[4, 7, 21, 147, 165, 176, 238]. The seed yields a strong mucilage and is therefore useful in the treatment of inflammation and ulcers of the stomach and intestines[4, 254]. Taken internally, a decoction of the ground seeds serves to drain off the sweat ducts[7]. The seed is very nourishing and body-building and is one of the most efficacious tonics in cases of physical debility caused by anaemia or by infectious diseases, especially where a nervous factor is involved[7, 244]. It is also used in the treatment of late-onset diabetes, poor digestion (especially in convalescence), insufficient lactation, painful menstruation, labour pains etc[238, 244]. The seeds freshen bad breath and restore a dulled sense of taste[254].

Externally, the seeds can be ground into a powder and used as a poultice for abscesses, boils, ulcers, burns etc, or they can be used as a douche for excessive vaginal discharge[4, 244, 254].

The leaves are harvested in the growing season and can be used fresh or dried[238]. The seeds are harvested when fully ripe and dried for later use[238].

Compounds extracted from the plant have shown cardiotonic, hypoglycaemic, diuretic, antiphlogistic and hypotensive activity[218]. One of its constituent alkaloids, called 'trigonelline', has shown potential for use in cancer therapy. The seed contains the saponin diosgenin, an important substance in the synthesis of oral contraceptives and sex hormones[244], whilst saponins in the plant have been extracted for use in various other pharmaceutical products[238].",Europe - S.

Although poisonous, saponins are poorly absorbed by the human body and so most pass through without harm. Saponins are quite bitter and can be found in many common foods such as some beans. They can be removed by carefully leaching the seed or flour in running water. Thorough cooking, and perhaps changing the cooking water once, will also remove most of them. However, it is not advisable to eat large quantities of food that contain saponins. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K].",,"Succeeds in ordinary garden soil[1], preferring a well-drained loamy soil in full sun[200]. Requires a warm, sheltered position in Britain[244].

Plants are hardy to about -15Â°c[238].

Fenugreek is widely cultivated for its edible seed in warm temperate and tropical regions, there are some named varieties[183]. Seed production is more problematic in Britain due to the cooler and moister summers. The seed is ripened intermittently over a period of some weeks making harvesting more complicated[87]. Plants take about 16 weeks to mature in warmer climes, probably about 4 weeks longer in Britain[200].

This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. When removing plant remains at the end of the growing season, it is best to only remove the aerial parts of the plant, leaving the roots in the ground to decay and release their nitrogen.","Seed - cooked or sprouted and eaten raw[2, 4, 21, 34]. It has quite a strong spicy flavour, not unlike lovage or celery[4, 183]. When ground into a powder, the seed is a principal ingredient of curries and mango chutney[244], it is also used in pickles and spice mixes, as a flavouring in bread etc[4, 183, 238]. The seed is usually lightly roasted before use in order to reduce the bitterness[238]. The seed is about 3mm long, about 10 - 20 seeds being produced in each pod[4]. A good source of many essential elements such as iron, phosphorus and sulphur[244], the seed contains about 6% moisture, 23% protein, 10% carbohydrate, 8% fat, 10% fibre and 4.3% ash[61]. The ground seeds are used to give a maple syrup flavour to foods[183]. The seed can be soaked for 12 hours in warm water and then allowed to sprout for 3 - 5 days[244]. These sprouted seeds have a spicy flavour and can be added to salads or cooked[238, K].

An essential oil obtained from the seed is used as a food flavouring in imitation maple syrup, vanilla compositions, liquorice, pickles etc[183]. It also has medicinal virtues[57]. The ground up seeds can also be used as a substitute for maple syrup[4].

Leaves - raw or cooked[2, 4, 7, 34]. Very aromatic, in small quantities they can be added to salads, otherwise they are used as a potherb, a flavouring for root vegetables, an ingredient of curries etc[183, 238].

Grows best with its roots in the shade and top growth in the sun[202]. Plants can become dormant in hot dry summers[90]. Grows best in a pH range from 5.3 to 7.5[196]. Prefers a turfy loam or a sandy peaty soil[1].

This species is not very hardy when grown outdoors in Britain. The top growth will survive light frosts, whilst the tubers, if well mulched, will survive to at least -5Â°c[1, 200].

Anu is sensitive to the number of hours of daylight in a day and most forms will not flower or form new tubers until late in the season (from September), so a mild autumn is required for good yields[33].The variety 'Ken Aslet', however, is not affected by daylight hours, it flowers from June to October and produces larger tubers than the species from mid-summer onwards[90, 104, 200].

The tubers are formed very near the surface of the soil[90] and so will require some protection, such as a mulch, if they are to be left in the ground over the winter[K]. The tubers can also be stored in a cool dry frost-free place over the winter and then planted out in April[200].

Long cultivated in the Andes for its edible root, there are many named varieties[2, 61, 90, 104, 196].  A potentially very high-yielding species, individual plants can produce up to 4 kilos of tubers - yields of 50 tonnes per hectare are possible[196].

A climbing plant, it supports itself by twisting its leaf stalks around other plants etc[219].

The caterpillars of the cabbage white butterfly can be a nuisance and often cause considerable damage to the leaves[219].","Tubers - cooked[1, 2]. A peppery flavour, it is rather unpleasant to many tastes[27, 34, 37]. The flavour can be improved somewhat by freezing the tubers after they have been cooked, they are then considered to be a delicacy by many people[183]. We have also noticed an improvement in the flavour if the tubers are harvested after they have been frosted, though if the frost is too heavy they can damage the tubers[K]. Other reports suggest half-drying the tubers before use[27, 34, 97, 183]. The tubers can be up to 10cm long and 5cm thick[260]. They are high in vitamin C[196]. The dried tuber contains up to 16% protein[196].

A very ornamental plant[1], it is only hardy in the milder parts of Britain[3], tolerating temperatures down to about -10Â°c when fully dormant[184]. The young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. Plants grow and fruit very well in Cornwall, indeed, in the past it has been cultivated commercially for its fruit there[11, 59] (it was one of Queen Victoria's favourite fruits), but is now normally only grown as an ornamental plant.

Prefers a deep rich loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[11, 200]. Best if given shade from the early morning sun in spring[200]. 

This species is considered by some botanists to be no more than a superior fruiting form of V. opulus that was taken to America by early settlers[11].

Occasionally cultivated for its edible fruit, there are some named varieties[183].

The fruit is very attractive to birds[160].

Some reports say that this species is self-fertile[17, 200] whilst others say it is self-incompatible[11].

Germination can be slow, sometimes taking more than 18 months. If the seed is harvested 'green' (when it has fully developed but before it has fully ripened) and sown immediately in a cold frame, it should germinate in the spring[80]. Stored seed will require 2 months warm then 3 months cold stratification and can still take 18 months to germinate[113].

The seeds are produced in pods 2 - 5cm long, each pod containing 3 - 4 round seeds the size of small peas[256]. They are eaten, when young, like green peas[2, 105, 118, 161], the flavour even of young seeds is rather strong, like old garden peas[256]. Some native North American Indian tribes regarded the seeds as poisonous, though other tribes would eat them as a snack.

The leaves are astringent, febrifuge, sedative, tonic and vermifuge[146, 147, 178, 218, 240]. They are useful in dispersing swellings of the joints from acute rheumatism, and of the testes from suppressed gonorrhoea[240]. The juice of the leaves is used for removing foetid discharges  and worms from ulcers, whilst an oil prepared with the leaf juice is applied to sinuses and scrofulous sores[240].They are harvested in early summer and used fresh or dried[238].

A decoction of the stems is used in the treatment of burns and scalds[218].

The dried fruit is vermifuge[240]. The fruit is also used in the treatment of angina, colds, coughs, rheumatic difficulties etc[218]. The fresh berries are pounded to a pulp and used in the form of a tincture for the relief of paralysis, pains in the limbs, weakness etc[4].

The root is expectorant, febrifuge and tonic[240]. It is used in the treatment of colds and rheumatic ailments[218]. It is harvested in late summer and autumn, and dried for later use[238].

Plants tolerate temperatures down to about -10Â°c[200]. They are not very hardy in Britain, they succeed outdoors at Kew[K], but in general are best given the protection of a sunny wall outside the milder areas of the country[11]. Plants only flower freely after a warm summer, so they are best grown against a sunny wall even in areas where they are hardy[219]. The flowers are produced so late in the season that they are unlikely to produce viable seed in this country even if they flower properly[K]. The plants require abundant summer sunshine in order to ripen their wood fully, the well-ripened wood is more frost resistant[11, 166].

There are some named forms, selected for their ornamental value[219].

The leaves and stems are strongly aromatic[182]. The flowers have a most pronounced musk-like perfume[245].","Seed - occasionally used as a condiment[177, 183], it is a pepper substitute. When washed to remove the bitterness it can be ground into a powder and used as a flour[179], though it is very much a famine food used only when all else fails[177].

Plants can take a few years to settle down after planting out[219]. Too much shade or too rich a soil are normally the culprits, some form of root restriction can be beneficial[219].

The name for this species was originally based on the cultivated garden form with white flowers. The true wild form is known as W. venusta violacea. Rehd[200].

Cultivated as a fibre plant in Japan[61].

There are several named varieties, develed for their ornamental value[249]. The flowers are scented, the smell can be either sweet or musky according to the variety being grown[249].

The plants flower mainly on short spurs so, if removing unwanted side-branches, it is best to cut them back to 2 - 3 leaves rather than removing them completely since this will encourage the formation of flowering spurs[249]. Any drastic pruning is best carried out in the spring, immediately after flowering[249]. Plants are very tolerant of even the most drastic pruning and will re-grow even if cut right back to the base[249].

A vigorous climbing plant supporting itself by twining around other plants, the shoots twine in an anticlockwise direction[184, 249].

Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].

This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. The plants also form a symbiotic relationship with a mycorrhizal fungus which makes more water, phosphorus and other minerals available to the plants[249].","Seed - cooked[105]. Some caution is advised, see notes on toxicity at the top of the page.

Young leaves - cooked[61, 105].","A fibre obtained from the bark is used for making cloth and thread[46, 61, 249].","The seed does not exhibit any dormancy habits. It can be sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame and should germinate in the spring. Pre-soak stored seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in a greenhouse in early spring. The seed can also be sown in an outdoor seedbed in late spring[126]. Germination should take place in the first spring, though it can sometimes be delayed for another 12 months. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer.  Plants are very slow from seed and can take up to 20 years to come into flower[200].

Basal cuttings of side-shoots in early to mid summer in a frame[200]. Take the cuttings as soon as the new growth has hardened sufficiently, each cutting should have 2 - 3 leaves[249]. It can also help to remove a shallow slice of bark from the bottom 15mm of the cutting to expose extra cambium, since this will encourage more callusing and better rooting[249]. When kept in a mist frame with a bottom heat of 27 - 30Â°c, they will root within 4 weeks and produce well-established plants by the autumn[249].

Layering in spring. Simply lay any convenient long shoot along the ground and cover it with a shallow layer of soil. The shoot will readily produce roots at intervals along the stem. When these are well formed, the shoot can be divided up into a number of plants.

This can be quite easily and successfully done using something like a small paint brush. This species, however, does not require the Yucca moth for pollination and will set fruit without hand pollination[11]. The flowers open at night[229] and are powerfully fragrant at this time[245].

A staple food for several native North American Indian tribes, the fruits are large, fleshy, sweet and palatable[85, 92, 95, 183]. The ovoid fruit is about 17cm long and 7cm wide[200]. Considered to be a luxury by the native North American Indians[207], the fruits were often baked in ovens[216]. The cooked fruit can be formed into cakes and then dried for later use[257]. Large quantities of the fruit has caused diarrhoea in people who are not used to it[85]. The dried fruit can be dissolved in water to make a drink[257].

The leaves can be reduced into fibre and then made into cloth[257]. To obtain the fibre, the terminal spine and a section of the back of the leaf are removed and pounded to free the fibre from the fleshy portion of the leaf[257]. Another method of obtaining the fibre was to fold the leaves into sections about 10cm long. The leaves were then boiled with a small quantity of cedar ashes. When sufficiently cooked, the leaves were placed in a bowl or basket and cooled, then youths and young women would peel off the epidermis and chew the leaves, starting at one end and finishing at the other. After chewing the leaves, the fibres were separated, straightened out and hung to dry. When required for weaving, they would first be soaked in water to soften them[257].

The whole leaf is sometimes split into sections and then tied together by square knots to make a rope[92, 257].

The leaf can be used as a paint brush[92]. Leaf slivers are used, the end being pounded to reveal the fibres[257]. The leaves have also been used to make small brushes for pottery decoration[257].

Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until the seedlings are large enough to plant out, which could take a few years. Seed is rarely available.

Division in late spring[25]. Best done as the new shoots first appear above ground[25]. Take divisions with at least three canes in the clump, trying to cause as little root disturbance to the main plant as possible. Grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse in pots of a high fertility sandy medium. Mist the foliage regularly until plants are established. Plant them out into their permanent positions when a good root system has developed, which can take a year or more[200].

The jujube is often cultivated in warm temperate zones for its edible fruit, there are many named varieties[50, 183]. The trees need a hot dry summer if they are to fruit well, which rather restricts their potential in a country like Britain[238, K].
